                    <p>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide</p>
                    <p><em>Weapon (Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, or Shortsword), Legendary (Requires
                        Attunement by a Creature of the Weapon’s Choice)</em></p>
                    <p>Of all the magic items created by elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a
                      <em>Moonblade</em>. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such weapon. Over
                      the centuries, some of these weapons have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines
                      have become extinct. Others have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few
                      of these weapons remain.</p>
                    <p>Every <em>Moonblade</em> longs for a bearer whose disposition and goals are compatible with its
                      own. If you try to attune to a <em>Moonblade</em> that doesn’t want you as its bearer, the weapon
                      not only rejects you but also places a curse on you, causing you to make D20 Tests with
                      Disadvantage for 24 hours or until the curse is ended by a <a
                        href="/content/spell#remove-curse">Remove Curse</a> spell or similar magic. If you’re
                      accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune
                      appears on it. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A
                      <em>Moonblade</em> functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen
                      bearer.</p>
                    <p>A <em>Moonblade</em> has one rune on it for each bearer it has willingly served (typically 1d6 +
                      1). The first rune grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
                      Each rune beyond the first grants the <em>Moonblade</em> an additional property. The DM chooses
                      each property or determines it randomly by rolling on the Moonblade Properties table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Minor Property.</strong> In addition to its aforementioned properties, each
                      <em>Moonblade</em> has a minor property determined by rolling on the Magic Item’s Minor Property
                      table</p>
                    <p><strong>Sentience.</strong> A <em>Moonblade</em> is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence of 12,
                      a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet. Its alignment
                      matches that of its creator.</p>
                    <p>The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the
                      wielder’s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate through
                      visions or dreams when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.</p>
                    <p><strong>Personality.</strong> A <em>Moonblade</em> has a personality similar to that of its
                      creator. Once a <em>Moonblade</em> has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person
                      should wield it, even if the bearer’s alignment differs from that of the weapon’s or the bearer’s
                      goals later clash with the weapon’s goals.</p>
