                    <p>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide</p>
                    <p><em>Wand, Artifact (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
                    <p>Crafted and wielded by Orcus, this ghastly wand slips from the demon lord’s grasp from time to
                      time. When it does, it magically appears wherever the demon lord senses an opportunity to achieve
                      some fell goal.</p>
                    <p>The wand is topped with a skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can
                      magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. All Holy Water within 10 feet
                      of the wand is destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand makes a DC 17 Constitution saving
                      throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 Necrotic damage. On a failed save, the
                      creature dies and, if it is a Humanoid, turns into a Zombie.</p>
                    <p><strong>Magic Weapon.</strong> You can wield the wand as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to
                      attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 Necrotic damage on a hit.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties (see
                      “Artifacts”):</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
                      <li>1 major beneficial property</li>
                      <li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>
                      <li>1 major detrimental property</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to
                      Orcus.</p>
                    <p><strong>Protection.</strong> You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spells.</strong> The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at
                      dawn. While holding the wand, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it (save
                      DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.</p>

                          <td>4</td>
                        </tr>

                        </tr>
                      </table>
                    </div>
                    <p>While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand’s spells
                      using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).</p>
                    <p><strong>Call Undead.</strong> While holding the wand, you can take a Magic action to conjure 15
                      Skeletons and 15 Zombies. These Undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in
                      unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until
                      the next dawn, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use
                      this property, you can’t use it again until the next dawn.</p>
                    <p>While holding the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of Undead, not just skeletons and zombies.
                      These Undead don’t perish at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sentience.</strong> The <em>Wand of Orcus</em> is a sentient Chaotic Evil item with an
                      Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120
                      feet.</p>
                    <p>The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Abyssal and Common.</p>
                    <p><strong>Personality.</strong> The wand’s purpose is to help satisfy Orcus’s desire to slay
                      everything in the multiverse. The wand is cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.</p>
                    <p>To further Orcus’s goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose
                      promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Destroying the Wand.</strong> Destroying the <em>Wand of Orcus</em> requires that it be
                      taken to the Positive Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the
                      long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has
                      imprisoned the hero’s soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.</p>
                    <p>Bathing the wand in positive energy (such as that which permeates the Positive Plane) causes it
                      to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on
                      Orcus’s layer of the Abyss.</p>
