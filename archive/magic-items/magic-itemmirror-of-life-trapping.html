                    <p>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide</p>
                    <p><em>Wondrous Item, Very Rare</em></p>
                    <p>When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of
                      creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic
                      damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0
                      Hit Points.</p>
                    <p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a
                      Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic
                      action and repeat the command word to deactivate it.</p>
                    <p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet
                      of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it
                      is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that
                      knows the mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save
                      automatically.</p>
                    <p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to
                      10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or
                      sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel.
                      Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p>
                    <p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the
                      mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature
                      appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror
                      is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p>
                    <p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it
                      or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears
                      as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate.</p>
                    <p>In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature
                      trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied
                      space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.</p>
                    <p>Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a <a
                        href="/content/equipment/magic-items/magic-itembag-of-holding">Bag of Holding</a>, <a
                        href="/content/equipment/magic-items/magic-itemportable-hole">Portable Hole</a>, or similar
                      item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where
                      the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind
                      Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.
                      The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.</p>
