                    <p>You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor or wall) or within
                      an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The glyph can cover an area no larger than
                      10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in place; if it is moved more than 10
                      feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being
                      triggered.</p>
                    <p>The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against
                      your spell save DC to notice.</p>
                    <p>When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death,
                      Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is explained below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Set the Trigger.</strong> You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For
                      glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing
                      another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed
                      within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.</p>
                    <p>You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the
                      glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t
                      trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>
                    <p>Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes,
                      after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted
                      by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its
                      turn there. A creature is targeted only once per turn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Death.</strong> Each target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic
                      damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
                    <p><strong>Discord.</strong> Each target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target
                      argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful
                      communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fear.</strong> Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened
                      condition for 1 minute. While Frightened, the target must move at least 30 feet away from the
                      glyph on each of its turns, if able.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pain.</strong> Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the
                      Incapacitated condition for 1 minute.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sleep.</strong> Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Unconscious
                      condition for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone takes an action to
                      shake it awake.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stunning.</strong> Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Stunned
                      condition for 1 minute.</p>
