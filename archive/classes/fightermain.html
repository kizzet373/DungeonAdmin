                    <p>Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened
                      mercenaries - as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they
                      are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.</p>
                    <p>Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool
                      at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond
                      that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some
                      concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their
                      martial skills with magic. This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization makes
                      Fighters superior combatants.</p>

                    <p>As a Fighter, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Fighter levels.
                      These features are listed on the Fighter Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Level 1: Fighting Style <a name="Fighting-Style"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain a <a href="/content/feats/featall.html#fighting">Fighting Style feat <purple>(updated)</purple></a> of
                      your choice (see chapter 5). <a href="/content/feats/featdefense">Defense</a> is recommended.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting
                      Style feat.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Level 1: Second Wind <a name="Second-Wind"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action,
                      you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.</p>
                    <p>You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you
                      regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p>When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second
                      Wind column of the Fighter Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc7"><span>Level 1: Weapon Mastery <a name="Weapon-Mastery"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or
                      Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills
                      and change one of those weapon choices.</p>
                    <p>When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more
                      kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Fighter Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc8"><span>Level 2: Action Surge <a name="Action-Surge"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one
                      additional action, except the Magic action.</p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting
                      at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc9"><span>Level 2: Tactical Mind <a name="Tactical-Mind"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can
                      expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit
                      Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into
                      a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc10"><span>Level 3: Fighter Subclass <a name="Fighter-Subclass"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The Battle Master, Champion, Eldritch Knight, and Psi
                      Warrior subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization
                      that grants you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of
                      your subclass’s features that are of your Fighter level or lower.</p>
