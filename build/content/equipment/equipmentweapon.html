                    <p>The Weapons table in this section shows the game's main weapons. The table lists the cost and
                      weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:</p>
                    <p><strong>Category.</strong> Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon
                      proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency
                      with Simple weapons.</p>
                    <p><strong>Melee or Ranged.</strong> A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee
                      weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a
                      greater distance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Damage.</strong> The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker
                      hits with it as well as the type of that damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Properties.</strong> Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column.
                      Each property is defined in the “Properties” section.</p>
                    <p><strong>Mastery.</strong> Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the “Mastery
                      Properties” section later in this chapter. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets
                      you use it.</p>

                    <h1 id="toc5"><span>Improvised Weapons</span></h1>
                    <p>If you use an object — such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle — as a makeshift weapon, see
                      <em>Improvised Weapons</em> in the rules glossary. Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in
                      an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.</p>
                    <h4 id="toc6"><span>Improvised Weapons (Rules Glossary)</span></h4>
                    <p>An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table
                      leg, or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also counts as an improvised weapon if it's
                      wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack or
                      throw a Melee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An
                      improvised weapon follows the rules below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Proficiency.</strong> Don't add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with an improvised
                      weapon.</p>
                    <p><strong>Damage.</strong> On a hit, the weapon deals 1d6 damage of a type the DM thinks is
                      appropriate for the object.</p>
                    <p><strong>Range.</strong> If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long
                      range of 60 feet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Weapon Equivalents.</strong> If an improvised weapon resembles a Simple or Martial
                      weapon, the DM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon's rules. For example, the
                      DM could treat a table leg as a Club.</p>
