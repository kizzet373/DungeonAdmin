                    <p>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide</p>
                    <p><em>Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
                    <p>Long ago, in the Dragonlance setting, elves and humans waged a terrible war against chromatic
                      dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and
                      forged five <em>Orbs of Dragonkind</em> to help defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of
                      the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards
                      used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>
                    <p>As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend,
                      and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped over the centuries. Their
                      primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, but they also allow some measure of control
                      over dragons.</p>
                    <p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax
                      magic from it. Those who try to wield an orb’s magic but lack sufficient force of personality
                      might find themselves under the orb’s control.</p>
                    <p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20
                      inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>
                    <p>While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb’s depths. You must then
                      make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you
                      remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long
                      as you remain attuned to it.</p>
                    <p>While you are Charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb
                      casts <a href="/content/spells/spellsuggestion">Suggestion</a> on you at will (save DC 18),
                      urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want
                      many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to
                      spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the DM decides.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has the following random
                      properties (see “Artifacts”):</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
                      <li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
                      <li>1 major detrimental property</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Spells.</strong> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at
                      dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The
                      table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.</p>
                    <div class="wiki-content-table-container">
                      <table class="wiki-content-table">

                        <tr>

                          <td>2</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>

                          <td>0</td>

                      </table>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Call Dragons.</strong> While you control the orb, you can take a Magic action to cause
                      the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons
                      in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon
                      deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be
                      Hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it
                      can’t be used again for 1 hour.</p>
                    <p><strong>Destroying an Orb.</strong> An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has AC 20 and is destroyed if
                      it takes damage from a <a href="/content/equipment/magic-items/magic-itemweapon-1-2-or-3">+3
                        Weapon</a> or a <a href="/content/spells/spelldisintegrate">Disintegrate</a> spell. Nothing
                      else can harm it.</p>
