                  <div id="page-content">

                    <p>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide</p>
                    <p><em>Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
                    <p>Vecna was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his
                      power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.</p>
                    <p>A treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna’s rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna,
                      all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna’s will
                      in the world.</p>
                    <p>The <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the <em>Hand of Vecna</em> are separate Artifacts that might be
                      found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The
                      hand is a shriveled left extremity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Random Properties of the Eye and Hand.</strong> <em>The Eye of Vecna</em> and the
                      <em>Hand of Vecna</em> each have the following random properties (see “Artifacts”):</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>1 minor beneficial property</li>
                      <li>1 major beneficial property</li>
                      <li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Attuning to the Eye.</strong> To attune to the eye, you must press it into your empty
                      socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. If the eye is ever
                      removed, you die.</p>
                    <p><strong>Properties of the Eye.</strong> While you are attuned to the eye, your alignment is
                      Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Truesight.</strong> You have Truesight out to 240 feet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> The eye has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily
                      at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Eye of Vecna Spells table from the eye (save DC 18). The
                      table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell
                      from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it,
                      and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the
                      DM’s control.</p>

                    <p><strong>X-ray Vision.</strong> You can take a Magic action to gain X-ray vision with a range of
                      30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don’t
                      prevent light from passing through themselves. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
                      common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin
                      sheet of lead.</p>
                    <p><strong>Attuning to the Hand.</strong> To attune to the hand, you must press it against the stump
                      where your left hand was. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage.
                      If the hand is ever removed, you die.</p>
                    <p><strong>Properties of the Hand.</strong> When you are attuned to the hand, your alignment is
                      Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Great Strength.</strong> Your Strength becomes 20 unless it is already 20 or higher.</p>
                    <p><strong>Icy Touch.</strong> Any melee spell attack you make with the hand and any melee attack
                      made with a weapon held by it deals an extra 2d8 Cold damage on a hit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> The hand has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily
                      at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Hand of Vecna Spells table from the hand (save DC 18). The
                      table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell
                      from it, the hand casts <a href="/content/spells/spellsuggestion">Suggestion</a> on you (save
                      DC 18; no Concentration required), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a
                      specific act in mind or leave it up to you.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Properties of the Eye and Hand.</strong> While attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain
                      the following additional benefits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Danger Sense.</strong> You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.</p>
                    <p><strong>Necrotic Reduction.</strong> As a Magic action, you can target one creature you can see
                      within 5 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 Necrotic
                      damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 Hit
                      Points by this damage is transformed into green slime (see chapter 3) that covers the ground in
                      its space, each 5-foot square of slime representing a separate patch. Nonmagical objects worn or
                      carried by the target that are made of metal or organic material are destroyed by the slime.</p>
                    <p><strong>Poison Immunity.</strong> You have Immunity to Poison damage and the Poisoned condition.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Regeneration.</strong> If you start your turn with at least 1 Hit Point, you regain 1d10
                      Hit Points.</p>
                    <p><strong>Wish.</strong> You can cast <a href="/content/spells/spellwish">Wish</a>. Once used,
                      this property can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Destroying the Eye and Hand.</strong> If the <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the <em>Hand of
                        Vecna</em> are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the <a
                        href="/content/equipment/magic-items/magic-itemsword-of-kas">Sword of Kas</a>, both the eye
                      and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the
                      eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna’s many hidden vaults, where
                      it waits to be rediscovered.</p>
