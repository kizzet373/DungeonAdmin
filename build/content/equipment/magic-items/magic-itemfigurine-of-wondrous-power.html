                    <p>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide</p>
                    <p><em>Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies</em></p>
                    <p>A <em>Figurine of Wondrous Power</em> is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take
                      a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the
                      figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine’s description below. If the space
                      where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t
                      enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.</p>
                    <p>The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your
                      commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no
                      commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
                    <p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the
                      creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops
                      to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to
                      figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until
                      a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.</p>
                    <h6 id="toc0"><span><strong>Bronze Griffon (Rare)</strong></span></h6>
                    <p>This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a Griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it
                      has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>
                    <h6 id="toc1"><span><strong>Ebony Fly (Rare)</strong></span></h6>
                    <p>This ebony statuette, carved in the likeness of a horsefly, can become a Giant Fly (see the
                      accompanying stat block) for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used,
                      it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.</p>
                    <h6 id="toc2"><span><strong>Golden Lions (Rare)</strong></span></h6>
                    <p>These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both
                      simultaneously. Each can become a Lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can’t be
                      used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
                    <h6 id="toc3"><span><strong>Ivory Goats (Rare)</strong></span></h6>
                    <p>These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and
                      functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p>
                    <p><strong>Goat of Terror.</strong> This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. The
                      goat can’t attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn
                      becomes a <a href="/content/equipment/magic-items/magic-itemweapon-1-2-or-3">+1 Lance</a>,
                      and the other becomes a <a href="/content/equipment/magic-items/magic-itemweapon-1-2-or-3">+2
                        Longsword</a>. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns
                      return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that
                      starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15
                      Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding
                      the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at
                      the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the
                      save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used,
                      it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Goat of Traveling.</strong> This figurine can become a Large goat with the same
                      statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in
                      goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs
                      out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it
                      regains all expended charges.</p>
                    <p><strong>Goat of Travail.</strong> This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once
                      it has been used, it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.</p>
                    <h6 id="toc4"><span><strong>Marble Elephant (Rare)</strong></span></h6>
                    <p>This marble statuette resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an Elephant for up to 24
                      hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
                    <h6 id="toc5"><span><strong>Obsidian Steed (Very Rare)</strong></span></h6>
                    <p>This polished obsidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only
                      to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>
                    <p>The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a
                      command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders,
                      you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where
                      the nightmare reverts to figurine form.</p>
                    <h6 id="toc6"><span><strong>Onyx Dog (Rare)</strong></span></h6>
                    <p>This onyx statuette of a dog can become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an
                      Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it
                      has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
                    <h6 id="toc7"><span><strong>Serpentine Owl (Rare)</strong></span></h6>
                    <p>This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours. The owl can
                      communicate telepathically with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.
                      Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.</p>
                    <h6 id="toc8"><span><strong>Silver Raven (Uncommon)</strong></span></h6>
                    <p>This silver statuette of a raven can become a Raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it
                      can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine grants you the
                      ability to cast <a href="/content/spells/spellanimal-messenger">Animal Messenger</a> on it.
                    </p>
