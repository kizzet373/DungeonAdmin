                    <p><em>Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
                    <p>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack
                      rolls and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons
                      that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Buttons.</strong> You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a
                      button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again,
                      which causes the rod to revert to its normal form:</p>
                    <p><strong>Button 1.</strong> A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head.
                      The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and the
                      blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire
                      damage on a hit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Button 2.</strong> The rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades
                      spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and
                      damage rolls made with it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Button 3.</strong> The rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the
                      rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic
                      Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Button 4.</strong> The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you
                      specify the length), though the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as
                      granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3
                      inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000
                      pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>
                    <p><strong>Button 5.</strong> The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a
                      +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other
                      barriers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Button 6.</strong> The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic
                      north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic
                      north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your
                      height above it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Drain Life.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can
                      force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an
                      extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that Necrotic
                      damage. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Paralyze.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can
                      force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the
                      Paralyzed condition for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns,
                      ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Terrify.</strong> While holding the rod, you can take a Magic action to force each
                      creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
                      save, a target has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened target repeats the save at
                      the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property
                      can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
