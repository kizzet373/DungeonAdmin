                    <p>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide</p>
                    <p><em>Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
                    <p>The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em>
                      figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular
                      faith, the book’s authors filled the pages with their own visions of true virtue, providing
                      guidance for defeating evil.</p>
                    <p><em>The Book of Exalted Deeds</em> rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it
                      vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring hope to an
                      endangered world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to
                      capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of
                      purpose.</p>
                    <p>A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book’s contents secure. Only a
                      creature that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is
                      opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its
                      contents and gain its benefits.</p>
                    <p>Other creatures that peruse the book’s open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning
                      and reap no benefits. A Fiend, an Undead, or a servant of a god from the Lower Planes that tries
                      to read from the book takes 24d6 Radiant damage. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity, and
                      it can’t be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage
                      disappears in a flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. The book then vanishes,
                      and the creature’s Attunement to it ends.</p>
                    <p>Benefits granted by the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> last only as long as you strive to do
                      good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10
                      days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.</p>
                    <p><strong>Celestial Calm.</strong> While attuned to the book, you have Immunity to the Charmed and
                      Frightened conditions and Resistance to Psychic damage. These benefits become permanent after you
                      spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book.</p>
                    <p><strong>Divine Wisdom.</strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying
                      the book, your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can’t gain this benefit from the
                      book more than once.</p>
                    <p><strong>Enlightened Magic.</strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and
                      studying the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a spell counts as a spell slot of one level
                      higher.</p>
                    <p><strong>Halo.</strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the
                      book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light
                      for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a Bonus Action. While present,
                      the halo gives you Advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks. In addition, Fiends and Undead
                      within the halo’s Bright Light make attack rolls against you with Disadvantage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> <em>The Book of Exalted Deeds</em> has the following random
                      properties (see “Artifacts”):</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
                      <li>2 major beneficial properties</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Destroying the Book.</strong> <em>The Book of Exalted Deeds</em> can’t be destroyed.
                      However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and
                      renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.</p>
