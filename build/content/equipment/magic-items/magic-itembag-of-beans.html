                    <p>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide</p>
                    <p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em></p>
                    <p>This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of
                      how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans.</p>
                    <p>If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on
                      them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere,
                      including you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Force damage on a failed save or
                      half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
                    <p>If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean
                      disappears as it produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM
                      can choose an effect from the following table or determine it randomly.</p>

                            existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24
