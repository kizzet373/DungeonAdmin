                    <p>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide</p>
                    <p><em>Weapon (Battleaxe), Artifact (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
                    <p>A young dwarf prince set out to forge a weapon that would be regarded as a symbol of unity among
                      his people. Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the prince
                      came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, a god of creation, he first
                      crafted four mighty tools: the Starmetal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the
                      Shaping Hammer. With these tools, he forged the <em>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.</em></p>
                    <p>Armed with the Artifact, the prince brought peace to the dwarf clans, ending grudges and
                      answering slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era
                      of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the
                      weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe
                      on for many generations.</p>
                    <p>Later, in an era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war
                      fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still
                      search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering
                      old vaults to find it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Magic Weapon.</strong> The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3
                      bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p>
                    <p>When you attack a creature with the axe and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the axe
                      deals an extra 20 Slashing damage.</p>
                    <p>The axe has the Thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When
                      you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra
                      2d8 Force damage if the target is a creature of the Giant type. Immediately after hitting or
                      missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.</p>
                    <p><em><strong>Blessings of Moradin.</strong></em> While attuned to the axe, you gain the following
                      benefits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have
                      Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fortitude of Stone.</strong> Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.</p>
                    <p><strong>Gifts of the Creator.</strong> You have proficiency with Brewer’s Supplies, Mason’s
                      Tools, and Smith’s Tools.</p>
                    <p><strong>One with the Forge.</strong> You have Immunity to Poison damage and Resistance to Fire
                      damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sunder.</strong> When you hit an object with the axe, the object takes the maximum amount
                      of damage possible.</p>
                    <p><em><strong>Conjure Earth Elemental.</strong></em> While holding the axe, you can take a Magic
                      action to summon an Earth Elemental. It appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet
                      of yourself, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after
                      you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 24 hours, when it dies, or when you
                      dismiss it as a Bonus Action. You can’t use this property again until the next dawn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> The axe has the following random properties (see
                      “Artifacts”):</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
                      <li>1 major beneficial property</li>
                      <li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Travel the Depths.</strong> You can take a Magic action to touch the axe to a fixed piece
                      of dwarven stonework and cast <a href="/content/spells/spellteleport">Teleport</a> from the
                      axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving
                      somewhere unexpected. You can’t use this property again until 3 days have passed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Destroying the Axe.</strong> The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the
                      Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 50 years before it
                      finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.</p>
