                    <p>Using Woodcarver’s Tools or Smith’s Tools, you can take a Magic action to create a Small or Tiny
                      Eldritch Cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of yourself. The
                      cannon’s game statistics appear below. You determine its appearance, which includes your choice of
                      legs or wheels. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it
                      early as a Magic action.<br>
                      Once you create a cannon, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest or expend a spell
                      slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can’t create one while your cannon
                      is present.</p>

                    <p>When you finish a Long Rest, you can use Woodcarver’s Tools to carve special sigils into a Rod,
                      Staff, or Wand and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object
                      if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>You can use your arcane firearm as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells. When you cast
                      an Artificer spell through the firearm, roll 1d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell’s
                      damage rolls equal to the number rolled.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Level 9: Explosive Cannon</span></h3>
                    <p>Every Eldritch Cannon you create is now more destructive. You gain the following benefits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Detonate:</strong> When your cannon is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you can take a Reaction
                      to command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon
                      and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell
                      save DC, taking 3d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
                    <p><strong>Firepower</strong>: The cannon’s damage rolls increase by 1d8.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc7"><span>Level 15: Fortified Position</span></h3>
                    <p>You’re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using your Eldritch Cannon. You gain the
                      following benefits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Double Firepower:</strong> You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create
                      two with the same Magic action (but not with the same spell slot), and you can activate both of
                      them with the same Bonus Action, ordering them to use the same activation option or different
                      ones. You can’t create a third cannon while you have two.</p>
                    <p><strong>Shimmering Field Projection:</strong> You and your allies have Half Cover while within 10
                      feet of your Eldritch Cannon.</p>
