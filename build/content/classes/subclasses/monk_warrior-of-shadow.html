                    <p><em>Harness Shadow Power for Stealth and Subterfuge</em></p>
                    <p>Warriors of Shadow practice stealth and subterfuge, harnessing the power of the Shadowfell. They
                      are at home in darkness, able to draw gloom around themselves to hide, leap from shadow to shadow,
                      and take on a wraithlike form.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Shadow Arts</span></h3>
                    <p>You have learned to draw on the power of the Shadowfell, gaining the following benefits.</p>
                    <p><strong>Darkness.</strong> You can expend 1 Focus Point to cast the <a
                        href="/content/spell#darkness">Darkness</a> spell without spell components. You can
                      see within the spell’s area when you cast it with this feature. While the spell persists, you can
                      move its area of Darkness to a space within 60 feet of yourself at the start of each of your
                      turns.</p>
                    <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have
                      Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Shadowy Figments.</strong> You know the <a
                        href="/content/spell#minor-illusion">Minor Illusion</a> spell. Wisdom is your
                      spellcasting ability for it.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Level 6: Shadow Step</span></h3>
                    <p>While entirely within Dim Light or Darkness, you can use a Bonus Action to teleport up to 60 feet
                      to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in Dim Light or Darkness. You then have Advantage
                      on the next melee attack you make before the end of the current turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 11: Improved Shadow Step</span></h3>
                    <p>You can draw on your Shadowfell connection to empower your teleportation. When you use your
                      Shadow Step, you can expend 1 Focus Point to remove the requirement that you must start and end in
                      Dim Light or Darkness for that use of the feature. As part of this Bonus Action, you can make an
                      Unarmed Strike immediately after you teleport.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 17: Cloak of Shadows</span></h3>
                    <p>As a Magic action while entirely within Dim Light or Darkness, you can expend 3 Focus Points to
                      shroud yourself with shadows for 1 minute, until you have the Incapacitated condition, or until
                      you end your turn in Bright Light. While shrouded by these shadows, you gain the following
                      benefits.</p>
                    <p><strong>Invisibility.</strong> You have the Invisible condition.</p>
                    <p><strong>Partially Incorporeal.</strong> You can move through occupied spaces as if they were
                      Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn in such a space, you are shunted to the last unoccupied
                      space you were in.</p>
                    <p><strong>Shadow Flurry.</strong> You can use your Flurry of Blows without expending any Focus
                      Points.</p>
