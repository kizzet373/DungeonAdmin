                    <p><em>Protect Nature and People from Destruction</em><br>
                      You stalk prey in the wilds and elsewhere, using your abilities as a Hunter to protect nature and
                      people everywhere from forces that would destroy them.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Hunter's Lore</span></h3>
                    <p>You can call upon the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and weaknesses of your prey.
                      While a creature is marked by your <a href="/content/spell#hunter-s-mark">Hunter's Mark
                        <purple>(buffed)</purple></a>, you know whether the creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or
                      Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Level 3: Hunter's Prey</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you finish a Short or Long
                      Rest, you can replace the chosen option with the other one.</p>
                    <p><strong>Colossus Slayer.</strong> Your tenacity can wear down even the most resilient foes. When
                      you hit a creature with a weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 damage to the target if it's
                      missing any of its Hit Points. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Horde Breaker.</strong> Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with a weapon,
                      you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5
                      feet of the original target, that is within the weapon's range, and that you haven't attacked this
                      turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 7: Defensive Tactics</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you finish a Short or Long
                      Rest, you can replace the chosen option with the other one.</p>
                    <p><strong>Escape the Horde.</strong> Opportunity Attacks have Disadvantage against you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Multiattack Defense.</strong> When a creature hits you with an attack roll, that creature
                      has Disadvantage on all other attack rolls against you this turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 11: Superior Hunter's Prey</span></h3>
                    <p>Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature marked by your <a
                        href="/content/spell#hunter-s-mark">Hunter's Mark<purple>(buffed)</purple></a>, you
                      can also deal that spell's extra damage to a different creature that you can see within 30 feet of
                      the first creature.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Level 15: Superior Hunter's Defense</span></h3>
                    <p>When you take damage, you can take a Reaction to give yourself Resistance to that damage and any
                      other damage of the same type until the end of the current turn.</p>
