                    <p>Eldritch Knights combine the martial mastery common to all Fighters with a careful study of
                      magic. Their spells both complement and extend their combat skills, providing additional
                      protection to shore up their armor and also allowing them to engage many foes at once with
                      explosive magic.</p>

                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Level 3: Spellcasting</span></h3>
                    <p>You have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information
                      below details how you use those rules as an Eldritch Knight.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two cantrips of your choice from the <a
                        href="/content/all-spells#class:wizard">Wizard spell list</a> (see that class’s
                      section for its list). <a href="/content/spell#ray-of-frost">Ray of Frost</a> and <a
                        href="/content/spell#shocking-grasp">Shocking Grasp</a> are recommended. Whenever you
                      gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip of your choice
                      from the Wizard spell list.</p>
                    <p>When you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots
                      you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are
                      available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 spells from the
                      Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to
                      cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 spells from the <a
                        href="/content/all-spells#class:wizard">Wizard spell list</a>. <a
                        href="/content/spell#burning-hands">Burning Hands</a>, <a
                        href="/content/spell#jump">Jump</a>, and <a
                        href="/content/spell#shield">Shield</a> are recommended.</p>
                    <p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared
                      Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose
                      additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the
                      number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For
                      example, if you’re a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells
                      of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.</p>
                    <p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can
                      replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard
                      spells.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your
                      Wizard spells.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 3: War Bond</span></h3>
                    <p>You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the
                      ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. The weapon must be within
                      your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the
                      bond. The bond fails if another Fighter is bonded to the weapon or if the weapon is a magic item
                      to which someone else is attuned.</p>
                    <p>Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you have
                      the Incapacitated condition. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon
                      as a Bonus Action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>
                    <p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but you can summon only one at a time with a Bonus Action.
                      If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 7: War Magic</span></h3>
                    <p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a casting
                      of one of your Wizard cantrips that has a casting time of an action.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Level 10: Eldritch Strike</span></h3>
                    <p>You learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s ability to withstand your spells.
                      When you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on the next
                      saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Level 15: Arcane Charge</span></h3>
                    <p>When you use your Action Surge, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can
