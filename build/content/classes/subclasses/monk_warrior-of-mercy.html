                    <p><em>Manipulate Forces of Life and Death</em></p>
                    <p>Warriors of Mercy manipulate the life force of others. These Monks are wandering physicians, but
                      they bring a swift end to their enemies. They often wear masks, presenting themselves as faceless
                      bringers of life and death.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Hand of Harm</span></h3>
                    <p>Once per turn when you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can expend 1
                      Focus Point to deal extra Necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die plus your
                      Wisdom modifier.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Level 3: Hand of Healing</span></h3>
                    <p>As a Magic action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to touch a creature and restore a number of Hit
                      Points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier.</p>
                    <p>When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the Unarmed Strikes with a use of this
                      feature without expending a Focus Point for the healing.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 3: Implements of Mercy</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain proficiency in the Insight and Medicine skills and proficiency with the Herbalism Kit.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 6: Physician’s Touch</span></h3>
                    <p>Your Hand of Harm and Hand of Healing improve, as detailed below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hand of Harm.</strong> When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can also give that
                      creature the Poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hand of Healing.</strong> When you use Hand of Healing, you can also end one of the
                      following conditions on the creature you heal: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, or Stunned.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Level 11: Flurry of Healing and Harm</span></h3>
                    <p>When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the Unarmed Strikes with a use of Hand of
                      Healing without expending Focus Points for the healing.</p>
                    <p>In addition, when you make an Unarmed Strike with Flurry of Blows and deal damage, you can use
                      Hand of Harm with that strike without expending a Focus Point for Hand of Harm. You can still use
                      Hand of Harm only once per turn.</p>
                    <p>You can use these benefits a total number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of
                      once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Level 17: Hand of Ultimate Mercy</span></h3>
                    <p>Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As a Magic action, you can
                      touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 Focus Points. The
                      creature then returns to life with a number of Hit Points equal to 4d10 plus your Wisdom modifier.
                      If the creature died with any of the following conditions, the creature revives with the
                      conditions removed: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, and Stunned.</p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
