                    <p><em>Withstand the Horrors of Frigid Wastelands</em></p>
                    <p>Winter Walkers hone their craft in the bleak and frozen wilds of places like Icewind Dale. Rimed
                      with ice, these ruthless Rangers hunt the monsters that haunt arctic wastelands, eventually
                      becoming frigid terrors themselves.</p>
                    <p>More so than any other Rangers of Icewind Dale, Winter Walkers are known to be well versed in the
                      paranormal phenomena specific to the realm, including the latent magic of fallen Netherese cities,
                      endemic monsters like yetis and crag cats, and the rising threat of Underdark invaders. In
                      exchange for their cold pragmatism, terrifying magic, and mastery of the region, these Winter
                      Walkers are regarded with equal parts respect and fear.</p>
                    <p>Ten-Towns citizens say that it is Winter Walkers’ frequent exposure to malignant entities that
                      gives them their fearsome powers. Many Reghed nomads, on the other hand, believe that nature
                      spirits bestow Winter Walkers with a unique curse.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Frigid Explorer</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the following benefits.<br>
                      <strong>Frost Resistance.</strong> You have Resistance to Cold damage.<br>
                      <strong>Polar Strikes.</strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d4
                      Cold damage to the target, which can take this extra damage only once per turn. This extra damage
                      ignores Resistance to Cold damage. When you reach Ranger level 11, this extra damage increases to
                      1d6.

                      equal to 1d10 plus your Ranger level.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, while a creature is marked by your <a

                    <p>Your experience surviving harrowing environments allows you to bolster your allies in addition to
                      yourself. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to
                      your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). A chosen creature regains Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus
                      your Ranger level and has Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Frightened condition for
                      1 hour.<br>
                      Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Level 11: Chilling Retribution</span></h3>
                    <p>When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to
                      make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has the
                      Frightened condition until the end of your next turn. While Frightened, a target’s Speed is
                      reduced to 0 feet.<br>
                      You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and
                      you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Level 15: Frozen Haunt</span></h3>
                    <p>When you cast <a href="/content/spells/spellhunter-s-mark">Hunter’s Mark</a>, you can adopt
                      a ghostly, snowy form. This form lasts until the spell ends, and while you are in this form, you
                      gain the following benefits. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
                      Long Rest unless you expend a level 4+ spell slot (no action required).</p>
                    <p><strong>Frozen Soul:</strong> You have Immunity to Cold damage. When you first adopt this form
                      and at the start of each of your subsequent turns, each creature of your choice in a 15-foot
                      Emanation originating from you takes 2d4 Cold damage.<br>
                      <strong>Partially Incorporeal:</strong> You have Immunity to the Grappled, Prone, and Restrained
                      conditions. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were Difficult Terrain, but you
                      take 1d10 Force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object. If the form ends while
                      you are inside a creature or an object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.
