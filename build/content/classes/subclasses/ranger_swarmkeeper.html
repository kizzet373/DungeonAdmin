                    <p><strong><em>Feeling a deep connection to the environment around them, some rangers reach out
                          through their magical connection to the world and bond with a swarm of nature spirits. The
                          swarm becomes a potent force in battle, as well as helpful company for the ranger. Some
                          Swarmkeepers are outcasts or hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant swarms rather
                          than dealing with the discomfort of others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant
                          communities that work for the mutual benefit of all those they consider part of their
                          swarm.</em></strong></p>

                            you in battle. While you’re alive, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or
                            flying and skittering around you within your space. You determine its appearance, or you
                            generate its appearance by rolling on the Swarm Appearance table.</p>

                          <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the <a href="/content/spell#mage-hand">Mage
                              Hand</a> cantrip if you don't already know it. When you cast it, the hand takes the form
                            of your swarming nature spirits. <purple>You can spend an action to hear and see from your
                              mage hand and whenever you cast a spell, you can have the spell cast from the location of
                              your Mage Hand instead, for the purpose of the spell's range.</purple>
                          </p>
                          <p>You also learn an additional spell of 1st level or higher when you reach certain levels in
                            this class, as shown in the Swarmkeeper Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell
                            for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p>

                          <p>Beginning at 7th level, you can condense part of your swarm into a focused mass that lifts
                            you up. As a bonus action, you gain a flying speed of 10 feet and can hover. This effect
                            lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated.</p>
                          <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain

                            feet of you, where you reappear with the swarm.</p>
                          <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain
