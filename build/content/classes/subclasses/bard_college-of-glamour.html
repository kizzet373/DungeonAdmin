                    <p><em>Weave Beguiling Fey Magic</em><br>
                      The College of Glamour traces its origins to the beguiling magic of the Feywild. Bards who study
                      this magic weave threads of beauty and terror into their songs and stories, and the mightiest
                      among them can cloak themselves in otherworldly majesty. Their performances stir up wistful
                      longing for forgotten innocence, evoke unconscious memories of longheld fears, and tug at the
                      emotions of even the most hard-hearted listeners.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Beguiling Magic</span></h3>
                    <p>You always have the <a href="/content/spell#charm-person">Charm Person</a> and <a
                        href="/content/spell#mirror-image">Mirror Image</a> spells prepared.</p>
                    <p>In addition, immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using a spell slot, you
                      can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to make a Wisdom saving throw against
                      your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed or Frightened condition (your
                      choice) for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the
                      effect on itself on a success.</p>
                    <p>Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also
                      restore your use of it by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration (no action required).</p>
                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Level 3: Mantle of Inspiration</span></h3>
                    <p>You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to fill others with vigor. As a Bonus Action, you
                      can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die. When you do so, choose a
                      number of other creatures within 60 feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your Charisma
                      modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of those creatures gains a number of Temporary Hit Points
                      equal to two times the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die, and then each can use its
                      Reaction to move up to its Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 6: Mantle of Majesty</span></h3>
                    <p>You always have the <a href="/content/spell#command">Command</a> spell prepared.</p>
                    <p>As a Bonus Action, you cast <a href="/content/spell#command">Command</a> without
                      expending a spell slot, and you take on an unearthly appearance for 1 minute or until your
                      Concentration ends. During this time, you can cast <a
                        href="/content/spell#command">Command</a> as a Bonus Action without expending a spell
                      slot.</p>
                    <p>Any creature Charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the Command you cast
                      with this feature.</p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also
                      restore your use of it by expending a level 3+ spell slot (no action required).</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 14: Unbreakable Majesty</span></h3>
                    <p>As a Bonus Action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you have
                      the Incapacitated condition. For the duration, whenever any creature hits you with an attack roll
                      for the first time on a turn, the attacker must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your
                      spell save DC, or the attack misses instead, as the creature recoils from your majesty.</p>
                    <p>Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long
                      Rest.</p>
