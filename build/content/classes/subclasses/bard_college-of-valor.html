                    <p><em>Sing the Deeds of Ancient Heroes</em><br>
                      Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers whose tales preserve the memory of the great
                      heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of the mighty in vaulted halls or to crowds
                      gathered around great bonfires. They travel to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that
                      the memory of these events doesn’t pass away. With their songs, they inspire new generations to
                      reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Combat Inspiration</span></h3>
                    <p>You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die
                      from you can use it for one of the following effects.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defense.</strong> When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use its
                      Reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that
                      attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.</p>
                    <p><strong>Offense.</strong> Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the
                      creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the attack’s damage
                      against the target.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Level 3: Martial Training</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor and Shields.</p>
                    <p>In addition, you can use a Simple or Martial weapon as a Spellcasting Focus to cast spells from
                      your Bard spell list.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 6: Extra Attack</span></h3>
                    <p>You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
                    <p>In addition, you can cast one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of
                      one of those attacks.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 14: Battle Magic</span></h3>
                    <p>After you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can make one attack with a
                      weapon as a Bonus Action.</p>
