                    <p><em>Craft Magic Armor to Enhance Your Abilities</em><br>
                      An Artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin.
                      The armor is enhanced to hone the Artificer’s magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a
                      formidable defense.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Tools of the Trade.</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain training with Heavy armor. You also gain proficiency with Smith’s Tools. If you already
                      have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your
                      choice.<br>
                      In addition, when you craft nonmagical or magic armor, the amount of time required to craft it is
                      halved.</p>

                    <p>When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Armorer Spells table, you thereafter always
                      have the listed spells prepared.</p>

                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 3: Arcane Armor.</span></h3>
                    <p>As a Magic action while you have Smith’s Tools in hand, you can turn a suit of armor you are
                      wearing into Arcane Armor. The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of
                      armor or you die.<br>
                      You gain the following benefits while wearing your Arcane Armor:</p>
                    <p><strong>No Strength Requirement.</strong> If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the
                      Arcane Armor lacks this requirement for you.<br>
                      <strong>Quick Don and Doff.</strong> You can don or doff the armor as a Utilize action.<br>
                      <strong>Second Skin.</strong> The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It
                      also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a Bonus
                      Action. The armor replaces missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.<br>
                      <strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use the Arcane Armor as a Spellcasting Focus for your
                      Artificer spells.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Level 3: Armor Model</span></h3>
                    <p>You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models:
                      Dreadnought, Guardian, or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you
                      wear it.<br>
                      Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your
                      Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, to the attack and damage
                      rolls.<br>
                      You can change the armor’s model whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest if you have Smith’s
                      Tools in hand.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc5"><span>Dreadnaught.</span></h5>
                    <p>You design your armor to become a towering juggernaut in battle. It has the following features:
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Armor Flail.</strong> An iron ball on a chain appears on one of your armor’s gauntlets
                      and has the following traits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Weapon Category:</strong> Simple Melee<br>
                      <strong>Damage on a Hit:</strong> 1d10 Bludgeoning plus the ability modifier used for the attack
                      roll<br>
                      <strong>Properties:</strong> Reach
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Giant Stature.</strong> As a Bonus Action, you transform and enlarge your armor for 1
                      minute. For the duration, your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you
                      become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there isn’t enough room for you to increase
                      your size, your size doesn’t change. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your
                      Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Wrecking Ball.</strong> If you hit a creature that is at least one size smaller than you
                      with the flail, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself or pull the
                      creature up to 10 feet toward yourself.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc6"><span>Guardian.</span></h5>
                    <p>You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:</p>
                    <p><strong>Thunder Gauntlets.</strong> Each of the armor’s gauntlets has the following traits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Weapon Category:</strong> Simple Melee<br>
                      <strong>Damage on a Hit:</strong> 1d8 Thunder plus the ability modifier used for the attack
                      roll<br>
                      <strong>Distracting Pulse.</strong> A creature hit by the gauntlet has Disadvantage on attack
                      rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Defensive Field.</strong> While you are Bloodied, you can take a Bonus Action to gain
                      Temporary Hit Points equal to your Artificer level. You lose these Temporary Hit Points if you
                      doff the armor.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc7"><span>Infiltrator.</span></h5>
                    <p>You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:</p>
                    <p><strong>Lightning Launcher.</strong> A gemlike node appears on one of the armor’s gauntlets or on
                      the armor’s chest (your choice). It has the following traits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Weapon Category:</strong> Simple Ranged<br>
                      <strong>Damage on a Hit:</strong> 1d6 Lightning plus the ability modifier used for the attack
                      roll<br>
                      <strong>Properties:</strong> Thrown (Range 90/300 feet)
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Lightning Jolt.</strong> Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with your
                      Lightning Launcher, you can deal an extra 1d6 Lightning damage to that target.</p>
                    <p><strong>Powered Steps.</strong> Your Speed increases by 5 feet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dampening Field.</strong> You have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor
                      normally imposes Disadvantage on such checks, the Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other, as
                      normal.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc8"><span>Level 5: Extra Attack</span></h3>
                    <p>You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc9"><span>Level 9: Armor Replication</span></h3>
                    <p>You learn an additional plan for your Replicate Magic Item feature, and it must be in the Armor
                      category. If you replace that plan, you must replace it with another Armor plan.<br>
                      In addition, you can create an additional item with that feature, and the item must also be in the
                      Armor category.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc10"><span>Level 15: Perfected Armor</span></h3>
                    <p>Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as detailed below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dreadnaught.</strong> The damage die of your Armor Flail increases to 2d6 Bludgeoning
                      damage. In addition, when you use your Giant Stature, your reach increases by 10 feet, your size
                      can increase to Large or Huge (your choice), and you gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Guardian.</strong> The damage die of your Thunder Gauntlets increases to 1d10 Thunder
                      damage. In addition, when a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of
                      you, you can take a Reaction to magically force that creature to make a Strength saving throw
                      against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly to an
                      unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of yourself, you can make a
                      melee weapon attack against it as part of this Reaction.<br>
                      You can take this Reaction a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of
                      once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Infiltrator.</strong> The damage die of your Lightning Launcher increases to 2d6. Any
                      creature that takes Lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light
                      until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds Dim Light in a 5-foot radius, and
                      it has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you.</p>
