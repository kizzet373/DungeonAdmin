                    <p><em>Channel Cosmic Forces of Order</em></p>
                    <p>The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm
                      like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You or someone from your
                      lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit
                      Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin
                      within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it’s part of a vast and
                      glorious system.</p>

                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 3: Restore Balance</span></h3>
                    <p>Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a
                      creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with Advantage or
                      Disadvantage, you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and
                      Disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and
                      you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Level 6: Bastion of Law</span></h3>
                    <p>You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of
                      order. As a Magic action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around
                      yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a
                      number of d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature
                      takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the
                      total rolled on those dice.</p>
                    <p>The ward lasts until you finish a Long Rest or until you use this feature again.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Level 14: Trance of Order</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the ability to align your consciousness with the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a
                      Bonus Action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you
                      can’t benefit from Advantage, and whenever you make a D20 Test, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower
                      on the d20 as a 10.</p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 5
                      Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Level 18: Clockwork Cavalcade</span></h3>
                    <p>You momentarily summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As a Magic action, you
                      summon the spirits in a 30-foot Cube originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other
                      Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the
                      effects below within the Cube before vanishing. Once you use this action, you can’t use it again
                      until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore
                      your use of it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Heal.</strong> The spirits restore up to 100 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any
                      number of creatures of your choice in the Cube.</p>
                    <p><strong>Repair.</strong> Any damaged objects entirely in the Cube are repaired instantly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dispel.</strong> Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects of your
                      choice in the Cube.</p>
