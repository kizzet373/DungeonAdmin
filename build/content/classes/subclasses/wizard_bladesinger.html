                    <p><em>Wield Sword and Sorcery in Elegant Tandem</em><br>
                      Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. In combat, a
                      Bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the
                      Bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have
                      observed a Bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in
                      their life— a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.</p>
                    <p>Bladesinging is strongly associated with the ancient elven societies that first mastered the art
                      and coined the term. Even today, most Bladesingers still hail from old elven realms, such as
                      Cormanthyr, or from non-elven societies that share land and history with elves, such as the Silver
                      Marches. Wherever they hail from, Bladesingers are known for taking their talents all across the
                      Realms in order to help common people and perform heroic deeds. Few communities greet the arrival
                      of a Bladesinger as anything but a good omen.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Bladesong</span></h3>
                    <p>As a Bonus Action, you invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided you aren’t wearing
                      armor or using a Shield.</p>
                    <p>The Bladesong lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, if you
                      don armor or a Shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. <purple>In
                        addition, it will end early at the end of your turn if you didn't make a melee attack that turn.
                      </purple> You can dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).</p>
                    <p>While the Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits. You can invoke the Bladesong a
                      number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended
                      uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Agility:</strong> You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier
                      (minimum of +1), and your Speed increases by 10 feet.<br>
                      <strong>Bladework:</strong> Whenever you attack with a weapon with which you have proficiency, you
                      can use your Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or
                      Dexterity.<br>
                      <strong>Focus:</strong> When you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration, you
                      can add your Intelligence modifier to the total.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Level 3: Training in War and Song</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain proficiency with all Melee Martial weapons that don’t have the Two-Handed or Heavy
                      property. You can use a Melee weapon with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus for
                      your Wizard spells.<br>
                      You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics,
                      Performance, or Persuasion.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 6: Extra Attack</span></h3>
                    <p>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
                      Moreover, you can cast one of your Wizard cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place
                      of one of those attacks.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 10: Song of Defense</span></h3>
                    <p>When you take damage while your Bladesong is active, you can take a Reaction to expend one spell
                      slot and reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to five times the spell slot’s level.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Level 14: Song of Victory</span></h3>
                    <p>After you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can make one attack with a
                      weapon as a Bonus Action.</p>
