                    <p><em>Harness Secrets Hidden in Constellations</em></p>
                    <p>The Circle of the Stars has tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets
                      hidden amid the constellations. By understanding these secrets, the Druids of this circle seek to
                      harness the powers of the cosmos.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Star Map</span></h3>
                    <p>You’ve created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can
                      use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the
                      Star Map table or by choosing one.</p>
                    <p>While holding the map, you have the <a href="/content/spells/spellguidance">Guidance</a> and
                      <a href="/content/spells/spellguiding-bolt">Guiding Bolt</a> spells prepared, and you can
                      cast <a href="/content/spells/spellguiding-bolt">Guiding Bolt</a> without expending a spell
                      slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of
                      once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p>If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This
                      ceremony can be performed during a Short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous map.</p>

                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 3: Starry Form</span></h3>
                    <p>As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form
                      rather than shape-shifting.</p>
                    <p>While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your
                      joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds
                      Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10
                      minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the Incapacitated condition,
                      or use this feature again.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on
                      your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.</p>
                    <p><strong>Archer.</strong> A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form
                      and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack,
                      hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the
                      attack deals Radiant damage equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.</p>
                    <p><strong>Chalice.</strong> A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you
                      cast a spell using a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature, you or another creature
                      within 30 feet of you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dragon.</strong> A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an
                      Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration, you can
                      treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 6: Cosmic Omen</span></h3>
                    <p>Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until
                      you finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special Reaction based on whether you rolled
                      an even or an odd number on the die:</p>
                    <p><strong>Weal (Even).</strong> Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to
                      make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the total.</p>
                    <p><strong>Woe (Odd).</strong> Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to
                      make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the
                      total.</p>
                    <p>You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and
                      you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Level 10: Twinkling Constellations</span></h3>
                    <p>The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes
                      2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a Fly Speed of 20 feet and can hover.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which
                      constellation glimmers on your body.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Level 14: Full of Stars</span></h3>
                    <p>While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you Resistance to
                      Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.</p>
