                    <p><strong><em>On many worlds, the moon is a revered celestial body with magical properties. On
                          Krynn, the gods of magic are associated with the world's three moons. On the world of Toril,
                          the god Selûne uses the light of the moon to battle darkness. On Eberron, scholars of the
                          Draconic Prophecy decipher ancient secrets from the waxing and waning of that world's twelve
                          moons.</em></strong></p>
                    <p><strong><em>You or someone from your lineage has been exposed to the concentrated magic of the
                          moon (or moons) of your world, imbuing you with lunar magic. Perhaps your ancestor was
                          involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon
                          crashed near you. However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious
                          when you cast sorcerer spells-perhaps making your pupils glow with the color of a moon from
                          your world, causing spectral manifestations of lunar phases to orbit you, or some other
                          effect.</em></strong></p>

                          <p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose what lunar phase manifests its power
                            through your magic: Full Moon, New Moon, or Crescent Moon. While in the chosen phase, you
                            can cast one 1st-level spell of the associated phase in the Lunar Spells table once without
                            expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you
                            finish a long rest.</p>
                          <h3 id="toc1"><span>Moon Fire</span></h3>
                          <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can call down the radiant light of the moon on command. You
                            learn the <a href="/content/spells/spellsacred-flame">Sacred Flame</a> spell, which
                            doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer cantrips you know. When you cast the spell, you
                            can target one creature as normal or target two creatures within range that are within 5
                            feet of each other.</p>

                          <p>Starting at 6th level, the current phase of your Lunar Embodiment can affect your Metamagic
                            feature. Each Lunar Embodiment phase is associated with certain schools of magic, as shown
                            here:</p>
                          <ul>

                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Crescent Moon.</strong> <a

                          </ul>
                          <p>Whenever you use Metamagic on a spell of a school of magic associated with your current
                            Lunar Embodiment phase, you can reduce the sorcery points spent by 1 (minimum 0). You can
                            reduce the sorcery points spent for your Metamagic a number of times equal to your
                            proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest</p>
                          <h3 id="toc3"><span>Waxing and Waning</span></h3>
                          <p>Starting at 6th level, you gain greater control over the phases of your lunar magic. As a
                            bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change your current Lunar Embodiment phase
                            for a different one.</p>
                          <p>You can now cast one 1st-level spell from each lunar phase of the Lunar Spells table once
                            without expending a spell slot, provided your current phase is the same as the lunar phase
                            spell. Once you cast a lunar phase spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish
                            a long rest.</p>
                          <h3 id="toc4"><span>Lunar Empowerment</span></h3>
                          <p>Starting at 14th level, the power of a lunar phase saturates your being. While you are in a
                            Lunar Embodiment phase, you also gain the following benefit associated with that phase:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Full Moon:</strong> You can use a bonus action to shed bright light in a 10-foot
                              radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet or to douse the light. In addition, you and
                              creatures of your choice have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom
                              (Perception) checks while within the bright light you shed.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>New Moon:</strong> You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In
                              addition, while you are entirely in darkness, attack rolls have disadvantage against you.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Crescent Moon:</strong> You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <h3 id="toc5"><span>Lunar Phenomenon</span></h3>
                          <p>At 18th level, as a bonus action, you can tap into a special power of your current Lunar
                            Embodiment phase. Alternatively, as part of the bonus action you take to change your lunar
                            phase using the Waxing and Waning feature, you can immediately use the power of the lunar
                            phase you are entering:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Full Moon:</strong> You radiate moonlight for a moment. Each creature of your
                              choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your
                              spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn. In addition, one creature of
                              your choice in that area regains 3d8 hit points.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>New Moon:</strong> You momentarily emanate gloom. Each creature of your choice
                              within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC
                              or take 3d10 necrotic damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next
                              turn. In addition, you become invisible until the end of your next turn, or until
                              immediately after you make an attack or cast a spell.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Crescent Moon:</strong> You can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you
                              can see within 60 feet of yourself. You can bring along one willing creature you can see
                              within 5 feet of yourself. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice
                              that you can see within 5 feet of your destination space. In addition, you and that
                              creature gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Once you use one of these bonus action benefits, you can’t use that benefit again until you
                            finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.</p>
