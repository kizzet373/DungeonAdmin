                    <p>Source: Player's Handbook</p>
                    <p><em>Unleash Chaotic Magic</em></p>
                    <p>Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an
                      ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to
                      Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or
                      your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within
                      you, waiting for any outlet.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Wild Magic Surge</span></h3>
                    <p>Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll 1d20
                      immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild
                      Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.</p>
                    <p>If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Level 3: Tides of Chaos</span></h3>
                    <p>You can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself Advantage on one D20 Test before you roll the
                      d20. Once you do so, you must cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot or finish a Long Rest before
                      you can use this feature again.</p>
                    <p>If you do cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot before you finish a Long Rest, you
                      automatically roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 6: Bend Luck</span></h3>
                    <p>You have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. Immediately after another creature you
                      can see rolls the d20 for a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction and spend 1 Sorcery Point to roll
                      1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the d20 roll.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 14: Controlled Chaos</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild
                      Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Level 18: Tamed Surge</span></h3>
                    <p>Immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot, you can create an effect of your
                      choice from the Wild Magic Surge table instead of rolling on that table. You can choose any effect
                      in the table except for the final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
