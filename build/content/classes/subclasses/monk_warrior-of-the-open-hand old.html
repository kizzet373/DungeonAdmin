                    <p><em>Master Unarmed Combat Techniques</em></p>
                    <p>Warriors of the Open Hand are masters of unarmed combat. They learn techniques to push and trip
                      their opponents and manipulate their own energy to protect themselves from harm.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Level 3: Open Hand Technique</span></h3>
                    <p>Whenever you hit a creature with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of
                      the following effects on that target.</p>
                    <p><strong>Addle.</strong> The target can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next
                      turn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Push.</strong> The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15
                      feet away from you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Topple.</strong> The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone
                      condition.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Level 6: Wholeness of Body</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You
                      regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1
                      Hit Point regained).</p>
                    <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and
                      you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Level 11: Fleet Step</span></h3>
                    <p>When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind
                      immediately after that Bonus Action.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Level 17: Quivering Palm</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with
                      an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which
                      last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an
                      action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one
                      of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of
                      existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force
                      damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
                    <p>You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the
                      vibrations harmlessly (no action required).</p>
