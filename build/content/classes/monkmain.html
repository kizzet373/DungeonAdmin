                    <p>Source: Player's Handbook</p>
                    <p>Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse
                      and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various
                      ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a
                      striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power
                      infuses all that a Monk does.</p>
                    <p>Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They
                      channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a
                      Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical
                      and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves
                      in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.</p>
                    <p>Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are
                      driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering
                      treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>As a Monk, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Monk levels. These
                      features are listed in the Monk Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Level 1: Martial Arts <a name="Martial-Arts"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your Unarmed Strike and
                      Monk weapons, which are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Simple Melee weapons</li>
                      <li>Martial Melee weapons that have the Light property</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you
                      aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bonus Unarmed Strike.</strong> You can make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.</p>
                    <p><strong>Martial Arts Die.</strong> You can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed
                      Strike or Monk weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts
                      column of the Monk Features table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dexterous Attacks.</strong> You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength
                      modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Monk weapons. In addition,
                      when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity
                      modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc7"><span>Level 1: Unarmored Defense <a name="Unarmored-Defense"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your
                      Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc8"><span>Level 2: Monk’s Focus <a name="Monks-Focus"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within
                      yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of
                      points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Monk Features table.</p>
                    <p>You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three
                      such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed
                      below.</p>
                    <p>When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the
                      end of which you regain all your expended points.</p>
                    <p>Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC
                      equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.</p>
                    <p><strong>Flurry of Blows.</strong> You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two Unarmed Strikes as a
                      Bonus Action.</p>
                    <p><strong>Patient Defense.</strong> You can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action.
                      Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and the Dodge actions as a
                      Bonus Action.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step of the Wind.</strong> You can take the Dash action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively,
                      you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and Dash actions as a Bonus Action, and
                      your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc9"><span>Level 2: Unarmored Movement <a name="Unarmored-Movement"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus
                      increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as shown on the Monk Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc10"><span>Level 2: Uncanny Metabolism <a name="Uncanny-Metabolism"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your
                      Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Monk level plus the number
                      rolled.</p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc11"><span>Level 3: Deflect Attacks <a name="Deflect-Attacks"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage,
                      you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack’s total damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10
                      plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.</p>
                    <p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s
                      force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a
                      melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind Total Cover if
                      the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take
                      damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the
                      same type dealt by the attack.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc12"><span>Level 3: Monk Subclass <a name="Monk-Subclass"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The Warrior of Mercy, Warrior of Shadow, Warrior of the
                      Elements, and Warrior of the Open Hand subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A
                      subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Monk levels. For the rest of your
                      career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Monk level or lower.</p>

                    <h3 id="toc15"><span>Level 4: Slow Fall <a name="Slow-Fall"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any damage you take from the fall by an amount
                      equal to five times your Monk level.</p>

                    <p>Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 1
                      Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a

                      successful save, the target’s Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next
                      attack roll made against the target before then has Advantage.</p>

                      a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step of the Wind.</strong> When you expend a Focus Point to use Step of the Wind, you can
                      choose a willing creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or smaller. You move the
