                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Magical Tinkering now allows the Artificer to craft low-cost items quickly.</li>
                      <li>Spellcasting now allows the Artificer to change one cantrip after each Long Rest.</li>
                      <li>Infuse Item has been redesigned and renamed to Replicate Magic Item. The feature allows the
                        Artificer to replicate any magic item of a qualifying rarity and item type.</li>
                      <li>Magic Item Tinker replaces Tool Expertise and lets you turn a magic item into a spell slot.
                      </li>
                      <li>Flash of Genius is now used in response to an ability check or a saving throw failing.</li>
                      <li>Spell-Storing Item has been changed to include level 3 Artificer spells.</li>
                      <li>Soul of Artifice no longer requires a Reaction to cheat death, and it restores you to 20 Hit
                        Points instead of <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1</span>. The feature’s other benefit now
                        enhances ability checks.</li>

                    <p>See the rules for the item in the Player’s Handbook. The item vanishes after 1 hour.</p>
                    <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once),
                      and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc8"><span>Level 1: Spellcasting</span></h3>
                    <p>You have learned how to channel magical energy through objects. See the Player’s Handbook for the
                      rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Artificer
                      spells, which appear in the Artificer spell list later in the class’s description.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tools Required.</strong> You produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use
                      Thieves’ Tools, Tinker’s Tools, or another kind of Artisan’s Tools with which you have proficiency
                      as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer
                      spell (meaning the spell has an “M” component when you cast it).</p>
                    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Acid Splash and
                      Prestidigitation are recommended.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with
                      another Artificer cantrip of your choice.</p>
                    <p>When you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as
                      shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to
                      cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are
                      available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Cure
                      Wounds and Grease are recommended.</p>
                    <p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the
                      Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose
                      additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the
                      table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re
                      a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of levels 1 and
                      2 in any combination.</p>
                    <p>If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don’t count
                      against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count
                      as Artificer spells for you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change
                      your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for
                      which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your
                      Artificer spells.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc9"><span>Level 2: Replicate Magical Item</span></h3>
                    <p>You have learned arcane plans that you use to make magic items.</p>
                    <p><strong>Plans Known.</strong> When you gain this feature, choose four plans to learn from the
                      Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2+) table (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide for the items’
                      descriptions). Bag of Holding, Cap of Water Breathing, Sending Stones, and Wand of the War Mage +1
                      are recommended. Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know
                      with a new plan for which you qualify.</p>
                    <p>You learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels, as shown in the
                      Plans Known column of the Artificer Features table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Creating an Item.</strong> When you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two
                      different magic items if you have Tinker’s Tools in hand. Each item is based on one of the plans
                      you know for this feature.</p>
                    <p>If a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it.
                      If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement.
                    </p>
                    <p>When you reach certain Artificer levels specified in the Magic Items column of the Artificer
                      Features table, the number of magic items you can create at the end of a Long Rest increases. Each
                      item you create must be based on a different plan you know.</p>
                    <p>If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item
                      vanishes, and then the new item appears.</p>
                    <p><strong>Duration.</strong> A magic item created by this feature functions exactly like the normal
                      magic item, except its magic isn’t permanent. When you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 of
                      days.</p>
                    <p>If an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it
                      vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p>

                    <p>You gain an Artificer subclass of your choice. The Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, and Battle
                      Smith subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that
                      grants you features at certain Artificer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of
                      your subclass’s features that are of your Artificer level or lower.</p>

                    <h3 id="toc16"><span>Level 3: Right Tool For The Job</span></h3>
                    <p>The list of items you can create with Magical Tinkering now includes Artisan’s Tools, which are
                      described in the Player’s Handbook.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc17"><span>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.
                    </p>
                    <p>You gain this feature again at Artificer levels 8, 12, and 16.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc18"><span>Level 6: Magic Item Tinker</span></h3>
                    <p>Your Replicate Magic Item feature improves as follows:</p>
                    <p><strong>Drain Magic Item.</strong> As a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of
                      yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and cause the item to vanish, converting its
                      magical energy into a spell slot. The slot is level 1 if the item is Common or level 2 if the item
                      is Uncommon or Rare. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long
                      Rest. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Expanded Replication.</strong> When you learn a plan for your Replicate Magic Item
                      feature, you can now also choose from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 6+) table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc19"><span>Level 7: Flash of Genius</span></h3>
                    <p>When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails an ability check or a saving
                      throw, you can take a Reaction to add a bonus to the roll, potentially causing it to succeed. The
                      bonus equals your Intelligence modifier.</p>
                    <p>You can take this Reaction a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of
                      once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc20"><span>Level 10: Magic Item Adept</span></h3>
                    <p>You’ve achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items, granting you the
                      following benefits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Additional Attunement.</strong> You can attune to up to four magic items at once rather
                      than three.</p>
                    <p><strong>Expanded Replication.</strong> When you learn a plan for your Replicate Magic Item
                      feature, you can now also choose from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 10+) table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc21"><span>Level 11: Spell-Storing Item</span></h3>
                    <p>Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch one Simple or Martial weapon or one item that you
                      can use as a Spellcasting Focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a level 1, 2, or 3
                      Artificer spell that has a casting time of an action (you needn’t have the spell prepared).</p>
                    <p>While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it,
                      using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires Concentration, the creature must
                      concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice
                      your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell
                      in an object.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc22"><span>Level 14: Magic Item Savant</span></h3>
                    <p>Your skill with magic items deepens, granting you the following benefits:<br>
                      Additional Attunement. You can attune to up to five magic items at once rather than three.</p>
                    <p><strong>Expanded Replication.</strong> When you learn a plan for your Replicate Magic Item
                      feature, you can now also choose from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 14+) table. You can
                      have no more than three Rare items created by Replicate Magic Item at a time.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc23"><span>Level 18: Magic Item Master</span></h3>
                    <p>You can now attune to up to six magic items at once rather than three.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc24"><span>Level 19: Epic Boon</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. <a
                        href="/content/feats/featboon-of-energy-resistance">Boon of Energy Resistance</a> is recommended.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc25"><span>Level 20: Soul of Artifice</span></h3>
                    <p>You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for aid.</p>
                    <p>You gain the following benefits:</p>
                    <p><strong>Cheat Death.</strong> If you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can
                      disintegrate one Uncommon or Rare magic item created by your Replicate Magic Item feature,
                      changing your Hit Points to 20 instead of 0.</p>
                    <p><strong>Magical Guidance.</strong> While you have Attunement to at least one magic item, you can
                      add 1d6 to any ability check you make. You decide to add the die after rolling the d20, and you
                      can use this benefit only once per turn.</p>
