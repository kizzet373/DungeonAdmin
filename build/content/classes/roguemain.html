                    <p>Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any
                      situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn
                      magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception,
                      while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
                      disarming traps and opening locks.</p>
                    <p>In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make on
                      precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.</p>
                    <p>Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while other used their cunning to fight crime.
                      Whatever a Rogue's relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the
                      subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.</p>

                    <p>You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Sleight of Hand and Stealth
                      are recommended if you have proficiency in them.</p>
                    <p>At Rogue Level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your Choice.</p>

                    <p>You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn you can deal an
                      extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and
                      the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same was the weapon's
                      type.</p>
                    <p>You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of
                      the target, the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition and you don't have Disadvantage on
                      the attack roll.</p>
                    <p>The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the
                      Rogue Features table.</p>

                    <h3 id="toc12"><span>Level 3: Steady Aim <a name="Steady-Aim"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on your current turn. You
                      can use this feature only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed
                      is 0 until the end of the current turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc13"><span>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement <a
                          name="Ability-Score-Improvement"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the <a href="/content/feats/featability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement feat</a> or

                    <h3 id="toc14"><span>Level 5: Cunning Strike <a name="Cunning-Strike"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you
                      can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the
                      number of Sneak Attack dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling,
                      and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the
                      Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before rolling.</p>
                    <p>If a Cunning Strike requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and
                      Proficiency Bonus.</p>
                    <p><strong>Poison (Cost: 1d6).</strong> You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a
                      Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute.
                      At the end of each of its turns, the poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on a
                      success.</p>
                    <p>To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner's Kit on your person.</p>
                    <p><strong>Trip (Cost: 1d6).</strong> If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a
                      Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.</p>
                    <p><strong>Withdraw (Cost: 1d6).</strong> Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your
                      speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc15"><span>Level 5: Uncanny Dodge <a name="Uncanny-Dodge"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve
                      the attack's damage against you (round down).</p>
                    <h3 id="toc16"><span>Level 7: Evasion <a name="Evasion"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you're subjected to an effect that
                      allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage
                      if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can't use this feature if
                      you have the Incapacitated condition.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc17"><span>Level 7: Reliable Talent <a name="Reliable-Talent"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Whenever you make an ability check that uses one of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can
                      treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc18"><span>Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike <a name="Improved-Cunning-Strike"></a></span>
                    </h3>
                    <p>You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die
                      cost for each effect.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc19"><span>Level 14: Devious Strikes <a name="Devious-Strikes"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You've practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among
                      your Cunning Strike options.</p>
                    <p><strong>Daze (Cost: 2d6).</strong> The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on
                      its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.</p>
                    <p><strong>Knock Out (Cost: 6d6).</strong> The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw,
                      or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious
                      target repeats the save at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Obscure (Cost: 3d6).</strong> The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it
                      has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc20"><span>Level 15: Slippery Mind <a name="Slippery-Mind"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma
                      saving throws.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc21"><span>Level 18: Elusive <a name="Elusive"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You're so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have
                      advantage against you unless you have the Incapacitated condition.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc22"><span>Level 19: Epic Boon <a name="Epic-Boon"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain an <a href="/content/feats/featall">Epic Boon feat</a> or another feat of your choice for which
                      you qualify. <a href="/content/feats/featboon-of-the-night-spirit">Boon of the Night Spirit</a> is
                      recommended.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc23"><span>Level 20: Stroke of Luck <a name="Stroke-of-Luck"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a d20 Test, you can turn
                      the roll into a 20.</p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p>
