                    <p>Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any
                      situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn
                      magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception,
                      while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
                      disarming traps and opening locks.</p>
                    <p>In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make on
                      precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.</p>
                    <p>Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while other used their cunning to fight crime.
                      Whatever a Rogue's relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the
                      subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.</p>

                    <h3 id="toc14"><span>Level 5: Cunning Strike <a name="Cunning-Strike"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you
                      can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the
                      number of Sneak Attack dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling,
                      and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the
                      Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before rolling.</p>
                    <p>If a Cunning Strike requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and
                      Proficiency Bonus.</p>
                    <p><strong>Poison (Cost: 1d6).</strong> You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a
                      Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute.
                      At the end of each of its turns, the poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on a
                      success.</p>
                    <p>To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner's Kit on your person.</p>
                    <p><strong>Trip (Cost: 1d6).</strong> If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a
                      Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.</p>
                    <p><strong>Withdraw (Cost: 1d6).</strong> Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your
                      speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc15"><span>Level 5: Uncanny Dodge <a name="Uncanny-Dodge"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve
                      the attack's damage against you (round down).</p>
                    <h3 id="toc16"><span>Level 7: Evasion <a name="Evasion"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you're subjected to an effect that
                      allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage
                      if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can't use this feature if
                      you have the Incapacitated condition.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc17"><span>Level 7: Reliable Talent <a name="Reliable-Talent"></a></span></h3>

                    <p>You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die
                      cost for each effect.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc19"><span>Level 14: Devious Strikes <a name="Devious-Strikes"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You've practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among

                    <p><strong>Daze (Cost: 2d6).</strong> The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on
                      its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.</p>
                    <p><strong>Knock Out (Cost: 6d6).</strong> The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw,
                      or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious
                      target repeats the save at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Obscure (Cost: 3d6).</strong> The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it
                      has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc20"><span>Level 15: Slippery Mind <a name="Slippery-Mind"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma

                    <h3 id="toc21"><span>Level 18: Elusive <a name="Elusive"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You're so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have
                      advantage against you unless you have the Incapacitated condition.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc22"><span>Level 19: Epic Boon <a name="Epic-Boon"></a></span></h3>
