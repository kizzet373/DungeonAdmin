                    <p>Source: Player's Handbook</p>
                    <p>Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic's inner workings. They cast spells of
                      explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic
                      conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective
                      barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or
                      open portals to other worlds.</p>
                    <p>Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of
                      magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as
                      Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now
                      used across the multiverse.</p>
                    <p>The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer.
                      Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime
                      or domination.</p>
                    <p>But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their
                      libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that
                      their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages,
                      and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in
                      the present age.</p>

                    <p>As a Wizard, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Wizard levels.
                      These features are listed in the Wizard Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Level 1: Spellcasting <a name="Spellcasting"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on
                      spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which
                      appear in the <a href="/content/spells/spellall.html#class:wizard">Wizard spell list</a> later in
                      the class’s description.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and
                      Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your
                      cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.</p>
                    <p>When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown
                      in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellbook.</strong> Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique
                      book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be
                      read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book’s appearance and materials,
                      such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.</p>
                    <p>The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your
                      choice. <a href="/content/spells/spelldetect-magic">Detect Magic</a>, <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellfeather-fall">Feather Fall</a>, <a

                        href="/content/spells/spellthunderwave">Thunderwave</a> are recommended.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook.
                      Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard
                      Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to
                      cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are
                      available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The
                      chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared
                      Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
                      Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen
                      spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard,
                      your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen
                      from your spellbook.</p>
                    <p>If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t
                      count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
                      count as Wizard spells for you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change
                      your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard
                      spells.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a
                      Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc6"><span>Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook</span></h5>
                    <p>The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research,
                      but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could
                      discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc7"><span>Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></h5>
                    <p>When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you
                      can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes
                      2 hours and costs 50GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your
                      spellbook.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc8"><span>Copying the Book.</span></h5>
                    <p>You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into
                      your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1
                      hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.</p>
                    <p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that
                      you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to
                      find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc9"><span>Level 1: Ritual Adept <a name="Ritual-Adept"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your
                      spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in
                      this way.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc10"><span>Level 1: Arcane Recovery <a name="Arcane-Recovery"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short
                      Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level
                      equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or
                      higher. For example, if you're a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell
                      slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.</p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc11"><span>Level 2: Scholar <a name="Scholar"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following
                      skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or
                      Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc12"><span>Level 3: Arcane Tradition <a name="Arcane-Tradition"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Abjurer, Diviner, Evoker, and Illusionist
                      subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants
                      you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
                      subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.</p>
