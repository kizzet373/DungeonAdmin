                    <p>Source: Player's Handbook</p>
                    <p>Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest
                      as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a
                      predator’s ferocity, a storm's fury, and a sea's turmoil.</p>
                    <p>Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a
                      connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an
                      expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not
                      just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.</p>
                    <p>Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into
                      danger so those under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes
                      Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>As a Barbarian, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Barbarian
                      levels. These features are listed in the Barbarian Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Level 1: Rage <a name="Rage"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary
                      might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.</p>
                    <p>You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of
                      the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you
                      regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p>While active, your Rage follows the rules below.<br>
                      <strong>Damage Resistance.</strong> You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing
                      damage.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Rage Damage.</strong> When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an
                      Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you
                      gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Strength Advantage.</strong> You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving
                      throws.</p>
                    <p><strong>No Concentration or Spells.</strong> You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast
                      spells.</p>
                    <p><strong>Duration.</strong> The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if
                      you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next
                      turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Make an attack roll against an enemy.</li>
                      <li>Force an enemy to make a saving throw.</li>
                      <li>Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage
                      for up to 10 minutes.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Level 1: Unarmored Defense <a name="Unarmored-Defense"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and
                      Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc7"><span>Level 1: Weapon Mastery <a name="Weapon-Mastery"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your training with weapons allows you to use the <a
                        href="/content/equipment/equipmentweapon.html#mastery-properties">mastery properties</a> of two kinds of Simple or
                      Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long
                      Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.</p>
                    <p>When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of
                      more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc8"><span>Level 2: Danger Sense <a name="Danger-Sense"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you
                      dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated
                      condition.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc9"><span>Level 2: Reckless Attack <a name="Reckless-Attack"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your
                      first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage
                      on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you
                      have Advantage during that time.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc10"><span>Level 3: Barbarian Subclass <a name="Barbarian-Subclass"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker, Path of the Wild Heart,
                      Path of the World Tree, and Path of the Zealot subclasses are detailed after this class’s
                      description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels.
                      For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of<br>
                      your Barbarian level or lower.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h3 id="toc12"><span>Level 3: Primal Knowledge <a name="Primal-Knowledge"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians
                      at level 1.</p>
                    <p>In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain
                      tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a
                      Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception,
                      Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing
                      through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc13"><span>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement <a
                          name="Ability-Score-Improvement"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the <a href="/content/feats/featability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement feat</a> or
                      another <a href="/content/feats/featall">feat of your choice</a> for which you qualify. You gain this
                      feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc14"><span>Level 5: Extra Attack <a name="Extra-Attack"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc15"><span>Level 5: Fast Movement <a name="Fast-Movement"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc16"><span>Level 7: Feral Instinct <a name="Feral-Instinct"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc17"><span>Level 7: Instinctive Pounce <a name="Instinctive-Pounce"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc18"><span>Level 9: Brutal Strike <a name="Brutal-Strike"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your
                      choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll
                      hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed
                      Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice.</p>
                    <p>You have the following effect options.</p>
                    <p><strong>Forceful Blow.</strong> The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then
                      move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hamstring Blow.</strong> The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your
                      next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time— the most recent one.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc19"><span>Level 11: Relentless Rage <a name="Relentless-Rage"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your
                      Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you
                      succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.</p>
                    <p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or
                      Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc20"><span>Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike <a name="Improved-Brutal-Strike"></a></span>
                    </h3>
                    <p>You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal
                      Strike options.</p>
                    <p><strong>Staggering Blow.</strong> The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes,
                      and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sundering Blow.</strong> Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by
                      another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one
                      Sundering Blow bonus.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc21"><span>Level 15: Persistent Rage <a name="Persistent-Rage"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage
                      in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p>In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do
                      anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious
                      condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc22"><span>Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike <a name="Improved-Brutal-Strike-2"></a></span>
                    </h3>
                    <p>The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different
                      Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc23"><span>Level 18: Indomitable Might <a name="Indomitable-Might"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you
                      can use that score in place of the total.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc24"><span>Level 19: Epic Boon <a name="Epic-Boon"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain an <a href="/content/feats/featall">Epic Boon feat</a> or another feat of your choice for which
                      you qualify. <a href="/content/feats/featboon-of-irresistible-offense">Boon of Irresistible Offense</a> is
                      recommended.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc25"><span>Level 20: Primal Champion <a name="Primal-Champion"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.
