                    <p>Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing
                      hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into
                      existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of
                      existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language.</p>
                    <p>Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They
                      become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.</p>
                    <p>A Bard's life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of
                      audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards' depth of knowledge and mastery of magic
                      sets them apart.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>As a Bard, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Bard levels. These
                      features are listed in the Bard Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Level 1: Bardic Inspiration <a name="Bardic-Inspiration"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is
                      represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.</p>
                    <p><strong>Using Bardic Inspiration.</strong> As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature
                      within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic
                      Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p>
                    <p>Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic
                      Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a
                      success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.</p>
                    <p><strong>Number of Uses.</strong> You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal
                      to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a
                      Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain
                      Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at
                      level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc7"><span>Level 1: Spellcasting <a name="Spellcasting"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See chapter 7 for the rules on
                      spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear
                      in the <a href="/content/spells/spellall.html#class:bard">Bard spell list</a> later in the class's
                      description.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. <a
                        href="/content/spells/spelldancing-lights">Dancing Lights</a> and <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellvicious-mockery">Vicious Mockery</a> are recommended.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your
                      choice from the Bard spell list.</p>
                    <p>When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell
                      list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
                      your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are
                      available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard
                      spell list. <a href="/content/spells/spellcharm-person">Charm Person</a>, <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellcolor-spray">Color Spray</a>, <a
                        href="/content/spells/spelldissonant-whispers">Dissonant Whispers</a>, and <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellhealing-word">Healing Word</a> are recommended.</p>
                    <p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared
                      Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells
                      from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table.
                      The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a
                      level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any
                      combination.</p>
                    <p>If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
                      against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count
                      as Bard spells for you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace
                      one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard
                      spells.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for
                      your Bard spells.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc8"><span>Level 2: Expertise <a name="Expertise"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain Expertise (see the rules glossary) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.
                      Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them.</p>
                    <p>At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc9"><span>Level 2: Jack of all Trades <a name="Jack-of-all-Trades"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a
                      skill proficiency you lack and that doesn't otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add
                      half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc10"><span>Level 3: Bard Subclass <a name="Bard-Subclass"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Dance, College of Glamour, College of
                      Lore, and College of Valor subclasses are detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a
                      specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you
                      gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower.</p>

                          name="Ability-Score-Improvement"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the <a href="/content/feats/featability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement feat</a> or
                      another <a href="/content/feats/featall">feat of your choice</a> for which you qualify. You gain this
                      feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc13"><span>Level 5: Font of Inspiration <a name="Font-of-Inspiration"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of
                      Bardic Inspiration.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc14"><span>Level 7: Countercharm <a name="Countercharm"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a
                      creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or
                      Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll
                      has Advantage.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc15"><span>Level 10: Magical Secrets <a name="Magical-Secrets"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You've learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level
                      (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you
                      can choose any of your new prepared spells from the <a

                      count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you
                      replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc16"><span>Level 18: Superior Inspiration <a name="Superior-Inspiration"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if
                      you have fewer than that.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc17"><span>Level 19: Epic Boon <a name="Epic-Boon"></a></span></h3>

                    <p>You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always
                      have the <a href="/content/spells/spellpower-word-heal">Power Word: Heal</a> and <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellpower-word-kill">Power Word: Kill</a> spells prepared. When you
                      cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of
                      the first target.</p>
