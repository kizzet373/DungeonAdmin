                                              defined by their exhaustive study of magic's inner workings. They cast
                                              spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and
                                              spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other
                                              planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers.
                                              Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors
                                              from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</em></span></td>
