                    <p>Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a
                      deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the
                      Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.</p>
                    <p>Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples
                      dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic
                      doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw
                      on power from the Outer Planes.</p>
                    <p>Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of
                      temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many
                      mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric
                      can.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>As a Cleric, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Cleric levels.
                      These features are listed in the Cleric Features table.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Level 1: Spellcasting <a name="Spellcasting"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on
                      spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which
                      appear on the <a href="/content/spells/spellall.html#class:cleric">Cleric spell list</a> later in
                      the class’s description.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellguidance">Guidance</a>, <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellsacred-flame">Sacred Flame</a>, and <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellthaumaturgy">Thaumaturgy</a> are recommended.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of
                      your choice from the Cleric spell list.</p>
                    <p>When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric
                      spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to
                      cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are
                      available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric
                      spell list. <a href="/content/spells/spellbless">Bless</a>, <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellcure-wounds">Cure Wounds</a>, <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellguiding-bolt">Guiding Bolt</a>, and <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellshield-of-faith">Shield of Faith</a> are recommended.</p>
                    <p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared
                      Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
                      spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on
                      the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if
                      you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in
                      any combination.</p>
                    <p>If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t
                      count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
                      count as Cleric spells for you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change
                      your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which
                      you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric
                      spells.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your
                      Cleric spells.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc7"><span>Level 1: Divine Order <a name="Divine-Order"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.</p>
                    <p><strong>Protector.</strong> Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and
                      training with Heavy armor.</p>
                    <p><strong>Thaumaturge.</strong> You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition,
                      your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion)
                      checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).</p>
                    <h3 id="toc8"><span>Level 2: Channel Divinity <a name="Channel-Divinity"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start
                      with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time
                      you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to
                      create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.</p>
                    <p>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you
                      finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain
                      additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of
                      the Cleric Features table.</p>
                    <p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this
                      class’s Spellcasting feature.</p>
                    <p><strong>Divine Spark.</strong> As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature
                      you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom
                      modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature
                      to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant
                      damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
                      damage (round down).</p>
                    <p>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).</p>
                    <p><strong>Turn Undead.</strong> As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead
                      creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If
                      the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For
                      that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on
                      the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc9"><span>Level 3: Cleric Subclass <a name="Cleric-Subclass"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain, Light Domain, Trickery Domain, and
                      War Domain subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization
                      that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of
                      your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc10"><span>Cleric Subclasses</span></h5>

                    </div>
                    <h3 id="toc11"><span>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement <a
                          name="Ability-Score-Improvement"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the <a href="/content/feats/featability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement feat</a> or
                      another <a href="/content/feats/featall">feat of your choice</a> for which you qualify. You gain this
                      feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc12"><span>Level 5: Sear Undead <a name="Sear-Undead"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum
                      of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of
                      Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn
                      effect.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc13"><span>Level 7: Blessed Strikes <a name="Blessed-Strikes"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you
                      get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this
                      feature).</p>
                    <p><strong>Divine Strike.</strong> Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack
                      roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage
                      (your choice).</p>
                    <p><strong>Potent Spellcasting.</strong> Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any
                      Cleric cantrip.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc14"><span>Level 10: Divine Intervention <a name="Divine-Intervention"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any
                      Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same
                      action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You
                      can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc15"><span>Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes <a
                          name="Improved-Blessed-Strikes"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.</p>
                    <p><strong>Divine Strike.</strong> The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.</p>
                    <p><strong>Potent Spellcasting.</strong> When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a
                      creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of
                      yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc16"><span>Level 19: Epic Boon <a name="Epic-Boon"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You gain an <a href="/content/feats/featall">Epic Boon feat</a> or another feat of your choice for which
                      you qualify. <a href="/content/feats/featboon-of-fate">Boon of Fate</a> is recommended.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc17"><span>Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention <a
                          name="Greater-Divine-Intervention"></a></span></h3>
                    <p>You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention
                      feature, you can choose <a href="/content/spells/spellwish">Wish</a> when you select a spell.
                      If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.</p>
