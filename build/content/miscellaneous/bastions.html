                    </div>
                    <p>A Bastion is a location that belongs to a player character: a home, a stronghold, and a place of
                      power that the character develops over the course of a campaign. A Bastion offers a character
                      temporary refuge from the dangerous world of adventuring, and it provides opportunities for a
                      character to craft magic items, conduct research, harvest poisons, build ships, and carry out a
                      range of other activities.</p>
                    <p>As DM, you decide whether Bastions are available in a campaign. Bastions are best suited to
                      campaigns that allow characters to return to their Bastions during intervals when they’re not
                      actively adventuring. Not every character needs to have a Bastion. It’s fine for some players in
                      your campaign to opt in to Bastion ownership and others to opt out.</p>
                    <p>There’s no need to choose between going on adventures and commanding a Bastion; a character can
                      do both at once. A Bastion has special facilities that generate benefits, and these facilities can
                      also undertake projects while the character is otherwise occupied.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, a Bastion is a creative playground for a player and a shared storytelling space
                      in the campaign. Be as permissive as you can with the stories players tell in their Bastions, but
                      players should know their control might be limited by the campaign’s larger story, which you
                      strive to make fun for everyone.</p>
                    <h1 id="toc0"><span><strong>Gaining a Bastion</strong></span></h1>
                    <p>If you allow Bastions in your campaign, characters acquire their Bastions when they reach level
                      5. You and the players can decide together how these Bastions come into being. A character might
                      inherit or receive a parcel of land on which to build their Bastion, or they might take a
                      preexisting structure and refurbish it. It’s fair to assume that work has been going on behind the
                      scenes of the campaign during a character’s early adventuring career, so the Bastion is ready when
                      the character reaches level 5.</p>
                    <p>The shape, style, and function of a character’s Bastion are up to the player to determine. For
                      example, a Wizard might build a tower, a Cleric might establish a shrine, a Fighter might build a
                      fortified keep or similar stronghold, and a Rogue might establish a guildhall or lodge. Characters
                      of other classes might choose one of these forms or combine them—a Paladin’s Bastion might be
                      similar to a Cleric’s shrine but as fortified as a Fighter’s stronghold. And multiple characters
                      can combine their Bastions to form a single large structure (see “Bastion Map”).</p>
                    <p>Every Bastion has facilities that serve basic needs as well as special ones, such as libraries,
                      menageries, and workshops (see “Basic Facilities” and “Special Facilities”).</p>
                    <h1 id="toc1"><span><strong>Bastion Turns</strong></span></h1>
                    <p>As time passes in the campaign, players take Bastion turns to reflect the activity occurring in
                      their Bastions, whether or not the characters are present. On a Bastion turn, a character can
                      issue orders to the special facilities in their Bastion or issue the Maintain order to the entire
                      Bastion (see “Orders”).</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Frequency of Bastion Turns</span></h3>
                    <p>By default, a Bastion turn occurs every 7 days of in-game time. Here are common examples of
                      players taking one or more Bastion turns:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The characters are on a long journey away from their Bastions. After the characters have been
                        away for 7 days, you might say, “Time for a Bastion turn. Since you’re not there, we’ll assume
                        you issue the Maintain order for your Bastions.” Then roll for events as described in the
                        “Bastion Events” section in this chapter.</li>
                      <li>The characters spend 7 days or more in their Bastions between adventures. You might say, “You
                        have six weeks to spend in your Bastions. Go ahead and resolve six Bastion turns.”</li>
                      <li>The characters return to their Bastions in the midst of an adventure. You might say, “You have
                        just enough time to take a Bastion turn before you leave again in the morning.”</li>
                      <li>The characters are adventuring near their Bastions and resting in their Bastions at night. You
                        might say, “It’s been a week since your last Bastion turn, so you can take one now.”</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can slow the frequency of Bastion turns to better serve the needs of your players and your
                      campaign. For example, if the characters have months between adventures, you can call for a
                      Bastion turn every month instead of every 7 days, so the characters aren’t issuing so many orders
                      or reaping too many benefits at once.</p>
                    <h1 id="toc3"><span><strong>Bastion Map</strong></span></h1>
                    <p>Encourage players to create floor plans of their characters’ Bastions, configuring its facilities
                      as they see fit and using the same techniques you use to create dungeon maps.</p>
                    <p>In addition to basic and special facilities, a Bastion can have the following features:</p>
                    <p><strong>Closets.</strong> A basic or special facility can have one or more closets, washrooms, or
                      similar enclosures. The closets must be inside the facility and can’t increase the facility’s area
                      in squares. These features are free.</p>
                    <p><strong>Corridors, Ramps, and Staircases.</strong> A facility can contain one or more corridors,
                      ramps, or staircases leading to other facilities in the Bastion. These features are free.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defensive Walls.</strong> A character can add defensive walls around their Bastion. A
                      defensive wall is 20 feet high and may include a walkway along its top, with a means to access it
                      (such as a ladder or lift). Each 5-foot square of defensive wall takes 10 days to build and costs
                      250 GP. If a character’s Bastion is completely enclosed by defensive walls and it comes under
                      attack (see “Bastion Events” at the end of this chapter), reduce by 2 the number of dice rolled to
                      determine how many Bastion Defenders are lost in the attack.</p>
                    <p><strong>Doors and Windows.</strong> Each facility comes with one or more doors and shuttered
                      windows, placed wherever the player sees fit. See “Doors” in chapter 3 for kinds of doors to
                      choose from, including locked doors, secret doors, and portcullises. These features are free.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Combining Bastions</span></h3>
                    <p>Two or more players can combine their characters’ Bastions into a single structure. Doing so
                      doesn’t change the number of special facilities each Bastion can have, how those special
                      facilities work, or who issues orders to each Bastion. Each Bastion retains its own hirelings,
                      which can’t be sent to or shared with another Bastion. Bastion Defenders are handled differently:
                      if some event deprives one character’s Bastion of defenders, another character can apply all or
                      some of those losses to their Bastion instead, provided the two Bastions are combined.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Facility Space</span></h3>
                    <p>The amount of space in a basic or special facility determines its maximum area in 5-foot squares,
                      as shown in the Facility Space table. A player can configure the squares of a facility as they
                      please on their Bastion’s map. The squares can be stacked so that a facility’s area is distributed
                      over multiple levels or stories.</p>

                    <h1 id="toc6"><span>Basic Facilities</span></h1>
                    <p>A character’s Bastion starts with two free basic facilities, which the character’s player chooses
                      from the Basic Facilities list below. One of the chosen facilities is Cramped, and the other is
                      Roomy (see the Facility Space table). A Bastion can have more than one of each basic facility.</p>
                    <p><strong>Basic Facilities</strong></p>
                    <p>Bedroom</p>
                    <p>Dining Room</p>
                    <p>Parlor</p>
                    <p>Courtyard</p>
                    <p>Kitchen</p>
                    <p>Storage</p>
                    <p>A basic facility comes with nonmagical furnishings and decor appropriate for that facility.</p>
                    <p>Basic facilities don’t have any game effects, but they can inspire roleplaying opportunities and
                      enhance a Bastion’s verisimilitude. A Bastion with a kitchen is functionally the same as one
                      without, but the former gives you and your players a fun setting to start game sessions, have
                      in-character discussions, or introduce new NPCs.</p>
                    <p>A character can add new basic facilities or enlarge existing ones by spending money and time, as
                      discussed in the sections that follow. Any number of basic facilities can be added or enlarged at
                      the same time. A character doesn’t need to be in their Bastion while basic facilities are being
                      added or enlarged.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc7"><span>Adding Basic Facilities</span></h3>
                    <p>A character can add a basic facility to their Bastion by spending money and time. The cost of
                      adding a basic facility and the time required depend on the facility’s space, as shown on the
                      table below.</p>

                      facility for cosmetic reasons or to increase the Bastion’s size.</p>
                    <p>A character can spend money and time to increase the space of a basic facility in their Bastion
                      by one category, as shown on the table below.</p>

                    <h1 id="toc9"><span><strong>Special Facilities</strong></span></h1>
                    <p>Special facilities are Bastion locations where certain activities yield game benefits. A
                      character’s Bastion initially has two special facilities of the character’s choice for which they
                      qualify. Each special facility can be chosen only once unless its description says otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Unlike basic facilities, special facilities can’t be bought; a character gains them through level
                      advancement. At level 9, a character gains two additional special facilities of their choice for
                      which they qualify; they gain one additional facility at level 13 and another at level 17. The
                      Special Facility Acquisition table shows the total number of special facilities in a character’s
                      Bastion. Each new special facility immediately becomes part of the character’s Bastion when the
                      character reaches the level.</p>
                    <p>Each time a character gains a level, that character can replace one of their Bastion’s special
                      facilities with another for which the character qualifies.</p>

                    <h3 id="toc10"><span>Requirements</span></h3>
                    <p>Each special facility has a level. A character must be that level or higher to gain that
                      facility. A special facility might also have a prerequisite the character must meet to gain that
                      facility. For example, only a character who can use an Arcane Focus or a tool as a Spellcasting
                      Focus can have an Arcane Study.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc11"><span>Space</span></h3>
                    <p>A special facility occupies a certain amount of space (see “Facility Space”). A player can
                      configure the squares of a special facility as desired on the Bastion’s map. A special facility
                      can be enlarged to grant additional benefits if its description says so.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc12"><span>Hirelings</span></h3>
                    <p>A special facility comes with one or more hirelings who work in the facility, maintain it, and
                      execute Bastion orders there, as described in the next section. A player can assign names and
                      personalities to hirelings in their character’s Bastion using the same tools DMs use to create
                      NPCs.</p>
                    <p>Each special facility in a Bastion generates enough income to pay the salary of its hirelings.
                      Hirelings follow the orders they’re given and are loyal to the Bastion’s owner.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc13"><span>Orders</span></h3>
                    <p>On a Bastion turn, a character in their Bastion can issue special orders - called Bastion orders
                      - to one or more of their Bastion’s special facilities. A character needn’t issue orders to all
                      the special facilities in their Bastion on a given Bastion turn.</p>
                    <p>The Maintain order is unusual; it is issued to the whole Bastion rather than to one or more
                      special facilities. If a character isn’t in their Bastion on a given Bastion turn, the Bastion
                      acts as though it were issued the Maintain order on that turn unless the owner can communicate
                      with the Bastion hirelings using the <a href="/content/spells/spellsending">Sending spell</a>
                      or similar magic.</p>
                    <p>The orders are as follows:</p>
                    <h5 id="toc14"><span>Craft</span></h5>
                    <p>Hirelings in the special facility craft an item that can be made in that facility. During the
                      time required to craft an item, the facility can’t be used to craft anything else, even if a
                      special ability allows the facility to carry out two orders at once. The hirelings have
                      proficiencies with Artisan’s Tools as specified in the facility’s description.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc15"><span>Empower</span></h5>
                    <p>The special facility confers a temporary empowerment to you or someone else.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc16"><span>Harvest</span></h5>
                    <p>Hirelings gather a resource produced in the special facility. During the time required to harvest
                      a resource, the facility can’t be used to harvest anything else, even if a special ability allows
                      the facility to carry out two orders at once.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc17"><span>Maintain</span></h5>
                    <p>All the Bastion’s hirelings focus on maintaining the Bastion rather than executing orders in
                      special facilities. Issuing this order prohibits other orders from being issued to the Bastion on
                      the current Bastion turn. Each time the Maintain order is issued, the DM rolls once on the Bastion
                      Events table. Bastion events are resolved before the next Bastion turn.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc18"><span>Recruit</span></h5>
                    <p>Hirelings recruit creatures to the Bastion. These creatures might include one or more Bastion
                      Defenders, whose main purpose is to defend the Bastion if it is attacked (see “Bastion Events”).
                      The Bastion generates enough income to provide for the needs of its Bastion Defenders.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc19"><span>Research</span></h5>
                    <p>Hirelings in the special facility gather information.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc20"><span>Trade</span></h5>
                    <p>Hirelings buy and sell goods or services stored or produced in this special facility.</p>
                    <h1 id="toc21"><span>Special Facility Descriptions</span></h1>
                    <p>Special facilities are presented in alphabetical order. The Special Facilities table lists all
                      the special facilities presented in this section, along with their prerequisites and orders. Some
                      facilities confer additional benefits, specified in their descriptions.</p>

                    <p>An Arcane Study is a place of quiet research that contains one or more desks and bookshelves.</p>
                    <p><strong>Arcane Study Charm.</strong> After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a
                      magical Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts”) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm
                      allows you to cast <a href="/content/spells/spellidentify">Identify</a> without expending a
                      spell slot or using Material components. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Craft Options.</strong> When you issue the Craft order to this facility, choose one of
                      the following options:</p>
                    <p><strong>Craft:</strong> Arcane Focus. You commission the facility’s hireling to craft an Arcane
                      Focus. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The Arcane Focus remains in your Bastion until
                      you claim it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Craft: Book.</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to craft a blank book. The
                      work takes 7 days and costs you 10 GP. The book remains in your Bastion until you claim it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Craft: Magic Item (Arcana).</strong> If you are level 9+, you can commission the
                      facility’s hireling to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the Arcana
                      tables in chapter 7. The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and the hireling has
                      proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the Arcana skill. See the “Crafting Magic
                      Items” section in chapter 7 for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the
                      item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility’s
                      hireling can assist), and you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the
                      item.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>An Archive is a repository of valuable books, maps, and scrolls. It is usually attached to a
                      Library behind a locked or secret door.</p>
                    <p><strong>Research: Helpful Lore.</strong> When you issue the Research order to this facility, you
                      commission the facility’s hireling to search the Archive for helpful lore. The work takes 7 days.
                      The hireling gains knowledge as if they had cast the <a
                        href="/content/spells/spelllegend-lore">Legend Lore</a> spell, then shares this knowledge
                      with you the next time you speak with them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reference Book.</strong> Your Archive contains one copy of a rare and valuable reference
                      book, which gives you a benefit while you and the book are in your Bastion. You can choose one of
                      the following options (your DM might make more options available):</p>
                    <p><strong>Bigby’s Handy Arcana Codex.</strong> You have Advantage on any Intelligence (Arcana)

                    <p><strong>The Chronepsis Chronicles.</strong> You have Advantage on any Intelligence (History)
                      check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about historical events, legendary
                      people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, wars, and lost civilizations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Investigations of the Inquisitive.</strong> You have Advantage on any Intelligence
                      (Investigation) check you make when you take the Study action to make deductions based on clues or
                      evidence or to recall lore about traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry.</p>
                    <p><strong>Material Musings on the Nature of the World.</strong> You have Advantage on any
                      Intelligence (Nature) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about terrain,
                      plants, animals, and the weather.</p>

                      prayers, hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p>
                    <p><strong>Enlarging the Facility.</strong> You can enlarge your Archive to a Vast facility by
                      spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, you gain two additional reference books chosen from the list
                      above.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>An Armory contains mannequins for displaying armor, hooks for holding Shields, racks for storing
                      weapons, and chests for holding ammunition.</p>
                    <p><strong>Trade: Stock Armory.</strong> When you issue the Trade order to this facility, you
                      commission the facility’s hireling to stock the Armory with armor, Shields, weapons, and
                      ammunition. This equipment costs you 100 GP plus an extra 100 GP for each Bastion Defender in your
                      Bastion. If your Bastion has a Smithy, the total cost is halved.</p>
                    <p>While your Armory is stocked, your Bastion Defenders are harder to kill. When any event causes
                      you to roll dice to determine if your Bastion loses one or more of its defenders (see “Bastion
                      Events” at the end of this chapter), roll 1d8 in place of each d6 you would normally roll. When
                      the event is over, the equipment in your Armory is expended regardless of how many Bastion
                      Defenders you have or how many you lost, leaving your Armory depleted until you issue another
                      Trade order to the facility and pay the cost to restock it.</p>

                    <p>A Bastion can have more than one Barrack, each of which is furnished to serve as sleeping
                      quarters for up to twelve Bastion Defenders.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recruit: Bastion Defenders.</strong> Each time you issue the Recruit order to this
                      facility, up to four Bastion Defenders are recruited to your Bastion and assigned quarters in this
                      Barrack. The recruitment costs no money. You can’t issue the Recruit order to this facility if
                      it’s fully occupied.</p>
                    <p>Keep track of the Bastion Defenders housed in each of your Barracks. If you lose Bastion
                      Defenders, deduct them from your roster. Assign names and personalities to your Bastion Defenders
                      as you see fit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Enlarging the Facility.</strong> You can enlarge your Barrack to a Vast facility by
                      spending 2,000 GP. A Vast Barrack can accommodate up to twenty-five Bastion Defenders.</p>

                      turn, you can relocate this door to another facility in your Bastion.</p>
                    <p>Only you and your Bastion’s hirelings can open the door, which leads to a Demiplane that takes
                      the form of a stone room. The Demiplane exists in an extradimensional space and therefore isn’t
                      attached physically to other locations in your Bastion. Neither the Demiplane nor its door can be
                      dispelled.</p>

                      gain Temporary Hit Points equal to five times your level after spending an entire Long Rest in the
                      Demiplane.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fabrication.</strong> While in the Demiplane, you can take a Magic action to create a
                      nonmagical object of your choice from nothing, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space in the
                      Demiplane. The object can be no bigger than 5 feet in any dimension; can’t have a value over 5 GP;
                      and must be made of wood, stone, clay, porcelain, glass, paper, nonprecious crystal, or
                      nonprecious metal. You must finish a Long Rest before you can take this action again.</p>

                    <p><strong>Research: Topical Lore.</strong> When you issue the Research order to this facility, you
                      commission the facility’s hireling to research a topic. The topic can be a legend, a known event
                      or location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object. The work takes 7
                      days. When the research concludes, the hireling obtains up to three accurate pieces of information
                      about the topic that were previously unknown to you and shares this knowledge with you the next
                      time you speak with them. The DM determines what information you learn.</p>

                      you gain Advantage on two kinds of saving throws for the next 7 days, determined randomly by
                      rolling on the table below. Reroll if you get a duplicate result.</p>

                    <p>Folks come here to consume tasty beverages and socialize. Your Pub might be a bar, coffee shop,
                      or tea room, and it might have a colorful name, such as the Rusty Flagon or the Dragon’s Loft. The
                      facility’s hireling, who serves as the bartender, maintains a network of spies scattered
                      throughout nearby communities. These spies are useful sources of information and frequent the Pub,
                      often incognito.</p>
                    <p><strong>Research: Information Gathering.</strong> When you issue the Research order to this
                      facility, you commission the Pub’s bartender to gather information from spies who are aware of all
                      important events happening within 10 miles of your Bastion over the next 7 days. During that time,
                      these spies can divulge the location of any creature that is familiar to you, provided the
                      creature is within 50 miles of your Bastion and not hidden by magic or confined to a location that
                      the DM deems is beyond the spy network’s ability to locate. If the spies learn the target’s
                      location, they also learn where that creature has been for the previous 7 days.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pub Special.</strong> The Pub has one magical beverage on tap, chosen from the options
                      below:</p>
                    <p><strong>Bigby’s Burden.</strong> Drinking a pint of this beverage grants you the “enlarge” effect
                      of an <a href="/content/spells/spellenlarge-reduce">Enlarge/Reduce</a> spell that has a
                      duration of 24 hours (no saving throw allowed).</p>
                    <p><strong>Kiss of the Spider Queen.</strong> Drinking a pint of this beverage grants you the effect
                      of a <a href="/content/spells/spellspider-climb">Spider Climb</a> spell that has a duration
                      of 24 hours.</p>
                    <p><strong>Moonlight Serenade.</strong> Drinking a pint of this beverage gives you Darkvision out to
                      60 feet for 24 hours. If you already have Darkvision, its range is extended by 60 feet for the
                      same duration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Positive Reinforcement.</strong> Drinking a pint of this beverage gives you Resistance to
                      Necrotic damage for 24 hours.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sterner Stuff.</strong> For 24 hours after drinking a pint of this beverage, you
                      automatically succeed on saving throws to avoid or end the Frightened condition.</p>
                    <p>At the start of a Bastion turn, you can switch to one of the other options. Your DM may create

                      Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts”) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you
                      to cast <a href="/content/spells/spellgreater-restoration">Greater Restoration</a> once

                    <p><strong>Harvest: Talisman.</strong> When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, you
                      commission its hireling to produce a specially prepared talisman for your use. The talisman
                      usually takes the form of an amulet, a rune-carved box, or a statuette, but it can be any Tiny,
                      nonmagical object that has religious significance. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. You
                      can use this talisman in place of one spell’s Material components, provided the components have a
                      cost of 1,000 GP or less. If the spell normally consumes its components, the talisman isn’t
                      consumed. After the talisman has been used in this way, it can’t be used again until you return it
                      to your Reliquary and use another Harvest order to prepare it.</p>

                      the following options:</p>
                    <p><strong>Craft: Holy Water.</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to craft a flask of
                      Holy Water. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. You can spend GP during the creation process
                      to increase the potency of the Holy Water. For every 100 GP you spend, up to a maximum of 500 GP,
                      the damage dealt by the Holy Water increases by 1d8.</p>
                    <p><strong>Craft: Magic Item (Relic).</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to craft a
                      Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the Relics tables in chapter 7. The facility
                      has the tool required to craft the item, and the hireling has proficiency with that tool as well
                      as proficiency in the Arcana skill. See the “Crafting Magic Items” section in chapter 7 for the
                      time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any
                      spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility’s hireling can assist), and you
                      must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell Refreshment.</strong> Having a Sacristy allows you to regain one expended spell
                      slot of level 5 or lower after spending an entire Short Rest in your Bastion. You can’t gain this
                      benefit again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>

                      allows you to cast <a href="/content/spells/spellheal">Heal</a> once without expending a

                    <p><strong>Empower: Fortifying Rites.</strong> When you issue the Empower order to this facility,
                      you inspire its hirelings to perform daily rites that benefit you or another character you name.
                      The beneficiary doesn’t need to be in the Bastion when the rites are performed to gain their
                      benefit. Each time the beneficiary finishes a Long Rest, they gain Temporary Hit Points equal to
                      your level. This effect lasts for 7 days.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sanctum Recall.</strong> While the Sanctum exists, you always have the <a

                      <a href="/content/spells/spellword-of-recall">Word of Recall</a>, you can make your Sanctum
                      the destination of the spell instead of another place you have previously designated. In addition,

                      one Cleric or Wizard spell of level 3 or lower. The facility has the necessary Calligrapher’s
                      Supplies, and the hireling meets all the prerequisites needed to scribe the scroll. The “Crafting
                      Equipment” section in the Player’s Handbook specifies the time needed to scribe the scroll and the
                      cost of the scroll, which you must pay.</p>
                    <p><strong>Craft: Paperwork.</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to create up to fifty

                      costs you 1 GP per copy. At no additional cost in time or money, the facility’s hireling can
                      distribute the paperwork to one or more locations within 50 miles of your Bastion.</p>

                    <p><strong>Craft: Magic Item (Armament).</strong> If you are level 9+, can you commission the

                      Items” section in chapter 7 for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the

                      these creatures’ stat blocks. The facility is big enough to house three Large animals. Two Medium
                      creatures occupy the same amount of space as one Large creature there. The facility’s hireling
                      looks after these creatures.</p>
                    <p>After a Beast that can serve as a mount spends at least 14 days in this facility, all Wisdom

                    <p><strong>Trade: Animals.</strong> When you issue the Trade order to this facility, you commission

                      in your Stable. The work takes 7 days, and the DM decides what types of animals are available for
                      purchase—horses, ponies, and mules being the most common. The Mounts and Other Animals table in
                      the Player’s Handbook gives standard prices for various mounts. You bear the total cost of any
                      purchases.</p>
                    <p>When you sell a mount from your Stable, the buyer pays you 20 percent more than the standard

                      level 17.</p>
                    <p><strong>Enlarging the Facility.</strong> You can enlarge your Stable to a Vast facility by

                      stores them in the Storehouse, or the hireling uses those 7 days to sell goods in the Storehouse.
                      You bear the total cost of any purchases, and the maximum value of the items purchased increases
                      to 2,000 GP when you reach level 9 and 5,000 GP when you reach level 13.</p>
                    <p>When you sell goods from your Storehouse, the buyer pays you 10 percent more than the standard

                      its hireling extends an invitation to a Friendly NPC spellcaster. Roll any die. If the number
                      rolled is odd, the invitee declines the invitation, and you gain no benefit from having issued the
                      order. If the number rolled is even, the invitee accepts the invitation and arrives in your

                    <p><strong>Empower: Theatrical Event.</strong> When you issue the Empower order to this facility,
                      its hirelings begin work on a theatrical production or concert. Rehearsals and other preparations
                      take 14 days, followed by at least 7 days of performances. The performances can continue
                      indefinitely until a new production gets underway.</p>
                    <p>You or another character can contribute to a production in the following ways:</p>
                    <p><strong>Composer/Writer.</strong> A character can compose music or write a script for a concert
                      or production that hasn’t started rehearsals yet. This effort takes 14 days.</p>
                    <p><strong>Conductor/Director.</strong> A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of
                      the production can serve as the concert’s conductor or the production’s director.</p>
                    <p><strong>Performer.</strong> A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the
                      rehearsal period can be a star performer in one or more of the performances; one of the Theater’s
                      hirelings can serve as an understudy for additional performances.</p>
                    <p>At the end of a rehearsal period, each character who contributed to the concert or production can
                      make a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check. If more of these checks succeed than fail, you and any
                      other character who contributed to the concert or production each gain a Theater die, a d6. This
                      die changes to a d8 when you reach level 13 and a d10 when you reach level 17. At any point after
                      the rehearsals end, a character can expend their Theater die to roll it and add the number rolled
                      to one D20 Test they make, immediately after rolling the d20. If a character hasn’t expended their
                      Theater die before gaining another, their first die is lost.</p>

                      gymnasium, a music or dance hall, or a cleverly built gauntlet of traps and hazards. It might
                      contain inanimate targets (for weapon practice), padded mats, and other equipment. One of the
                      facility’s hirelings is an expert trainer; the others serve as training partners.</p>
                    <p>When a Training Area becomes part of your Bastion, choose one trainer from the Expert Trainers
                      table. On each Bastion turn, you can replace that trainer with another one from the table.</p>

                      of the following options:</p>
                    <p><strong>Research: Lore.</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to research a topic of
                      your choice. The topic can be a legend, any kind of creature, or a famous object. The topic need
                      not be directly related to items on display in the room, as the trophies provide clues to research
                      a wide variety of other subjects. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, the hireling
                      obtains up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to
                      you and shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them. The DM determines what
                      information is learned.</p>
                    <p><strong>Research: Trinket Trophy.</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to search for a
                      trinket that might be of use to you. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, roll any
                      die. If the number rolled is odd, the hireling finds nothing useful. If the number rolled is even,
                      the hireling finds a magic item. Roll on the Implements - Common table in chapter 7 to determine
                      what it is.</p>

                    <p>The War Room is where you plan military actions in consultation with an inner circle of loyal
                      lieutenants, each one a battle-hardened Veteran Warrior (see the Monster Manual) whose alignment
                      matches yours. You start with two lieutenants but can add more, as described below. If your
                      Bastion lacks facilities to house your lieutenants, they secure accommodations in the inn or
                      settlement closest to your Bastion. Lieutenants are hirelings, not Bastion Defenders; however, if
                      your Bastion is attacked (see “Bastion Events” at the end of this chapter), each lieutenant housed
                      in your Bastion reduces by 1 the number of dice you roll to determine how many Bastion Defenders
                      are lost in the attack.</p>
                    <p>The War Room contains war memorabilia plus a large table surrounded by enough chairs for you and
                      your lieutenants.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recruit Options.</strong> When you issue the Recruit order to this facility, choose one
                      of the following options:</p>
                    <p><strong>Recruit: Lieutenant.</strong> You gain one new lieutenant. You can have up to ten
                      lieutenants at any time. Assign names and personalities to them as you see fit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recruit: Soldiers.</strong> You commission one or more of your lieutenants to assemble a
                      small army. Each lieutenant can muster one hundred Guards (see the Monster Manual) in 7 days to
                      fight for your cause. Reduce that number to twenty if you want them to be mounted on Riding Horses
                      (see the Monster Manual). It costs you 1 GP per day to feed each guard and each horse in your
                      army. Wherever the army goes, it must be led by you or at least one of your lieutenants, or else
                      it disbands immediately. The army also disbands if it goes 1 day without being fed. Otherwise, the
                      army remains until it is destroyed or you command it to disband. You can’t issue this Recruit
                      order again until your current army disbands or is destroyed.</p>

                    <p>This Workshop is a creative space where useful items can be crafted.</p>
                    <p><strong>Artisan’s Tools.</strong> The Workshop comes equipped with six different kinds of
                      Artisan’s Tools, chosen from the following list:</p>
                    <p>Carpenter’s Tools</p>
                    <p>Cobbler’s Tools</p>

                    <p>Mason’s Tools</p>

                    <p>Weaver’s Tools</p>
                    <p>Woodcarver’s Tools</p>
                    <p><strong>Craft Options.</strong> When you issue the Craft order to this facility, choose one of
                      the following options:</p>
                    <p><strong>Craft: Adventuring Gear.</strong> The facility’s hirelings craft anything that can be
                      made with the tools you chose when you added the Workshop to your Bastion (see above), using the
                      rules in the Player’s Handbook.</p>
                    <p><strong>Craft: Magic Item (Implement).</strong> If you are level 9+, you can commission the
                      facility’s hirelings to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the Implements
                      tables in chapter 7. The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and the hirelings have
                      proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the Arcana skill. See the “Crafting Magic
                      Items” section in chapter 7 for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the
                      item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility’s
                      hirelings can assist), and you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting
                      the item.</p>
                    <p><strong>Source of Inspiration.</strong> After spending an entire Short Rest in your Workshop, you
                      gain Heroic Inspiration. You can’t gain this benefit again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Enlarging the Facility.</strong> You can enlarge your Workshop to a Vast facility by
                      spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, the Workshop gains two additional hirelings and three additional
                      Artisan’s Tools (chosen from the list above).</p>
                    <h1 id="toc51"><span><strong>Bastion Events</strong></span></h1>
                    <p>Immediately after a character issues the Maintain order to their Bastion, the DM rolls once on
                      the Bastion Events table to determine what event, if any, befalls the Bastion before the next
                      Bastion Turn. If an event occurs, the DM reads the event aloud to the player whose character
                      controls that Bastion. (All the events are described in the sections following the table.) The
                      event is resolved immediately, with the player and DM working together to expand story details as
                      needed. If multiple characters issue the Maintain order on the same Bastion turn, roll once on the
                      table for each of them, resolving each event separately even if the Bastions are combined.</p>
                    <p>Bastion events occur only when a Bastion is operating under the Maintain order, which often means
                      that the Bastion’s owner isn’t present in the Bastion at the time. That means these events can be
                      opportunities for the player to take on the role of the Bastion’s hirelings and roleplay their
                      reactions to these events. The DM can even turn a Bastion event into a cutscene where each player
                      takes on the role of one of the Bastion’s hirelings (under the guidance of the player whose
                      character owns the Bastion).</p>

                      by paying a bribe of 1d6 × 100 GP. Otherwise, the hireling is arrested and taken away. If this

                      the details.</p>
                    <p>If you seize the opportunity, you must pay 500 GP to cover costs. In return, your Bastion gains a
                      sudden influx of recognition or attention, prompting the DM to roll again on the Bastion Events
                      table (rerolling this result if it comes up again).</p>

                      1d6 × 100 GP for the brief use of that facility. For example, a knight might want your Smithy to
                      replace a horseshoe or repair a damaged weapon or suit of armor, or sages might need your Arcane
                      Study to help them settle a dispute. Their use of the facility doesn’t interrupt any orders you’ve

                      the refugees camp right outside the Bastion. The refugees offer you 1d6 × 100 GP as payment for
                      your hospitality and protection. They stay until you find them a new home or a hostile force

                    <p>Your Bastion is called on to help a local leader. Perhaps there’s a search on for a missing
                      person, or brigands are plaguing the area. If you help, you must dispatch one or more Bastion
                      Defenders. Roll 1d6 for each Bastion Defender you send. If the total is 10 or higher, the problem
                      is solved and you earn a reward of 1d6 × 100 GP. If the total is less than 10, the problem is
                      still solved, but the reward is halved and one of your Bastion Defenders is killed. Remove that
                      Bastion Defender from your Bastion’s roster.</p>

                      you. It might represent an inheritance, a gift from a guest or an admirer, a theft, or a fortunate
                      discovery. If you’re in the Bastion, you can claim the treasure immediately; otherwise, it is
                      placed in storage until you can claim it.</p>

                    <p>A player character can lose their Bastion in the following ways:</p>
                    <p><strong>Divestiture.</strong> A character can give up their Bastion anytime, releasing the
                      Bastion’s hirelings and abandoning the location. The divested Bastion is quickly vacated, is
                      eventually looted, and might even be burned to the ground.</p>
                    <p><strong>Neglect.</strong> If a character issues no orders to their Bastion for a number of
                      consecutive Bastion turns equal to the character’s level (typically because the character is dead
                      or otherwise out of commission), the hirelings abandon the Bastion and the site is eventually
                      looted. If the character returns later, they can start a new Bastion, perhaps building it amid the
                      ruins of the old one.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ruination.</strong> Drawing the Ruin card from the <a
                        href="/content/equipment/magic-items/magic-itemdeck-of-many-things">Deck of Many Things</a>
                      instantly deprives a character of their Bastion. When such an event occurs, the player can decide
                      what terrible fate befalls the Bastion. The Bastion might be sacked by enemies or destroyed by an
                      earthquake, for example.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of how the Bastion falls, the player can work with the DM to establish a new Bastion
                      and determine how it comes into being. Use the Special Facility Acquisition table to determine how
                      many special facilities come with it. The new Bastion also starts with two basic facilities (one
                      Cramped and one Roomy) of the player’s choice.</p>
