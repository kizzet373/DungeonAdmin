                  <div id="page-content">

                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Maneuver Options</span></h3>
                    <p>The maneuvers are presented here in alphabetical order.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ambush.</strong><br>
                      When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an Initiative roll, you can expend one Superiority
                      Die and add the die to the roll, unless you have the Incapacitated condition.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bait and Switch.</strong><br>
                      When you’re within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one Superiority Die and
                      switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature
                      is willing and doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition. This movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity
                      Attacks.</p>
                    <p>Roll the Superiority Die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your
                      choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.</p>
                    <p><strong>Commander’s Strike.</strong><br>
                      When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks to direct one of
                      your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a willing creature who can see or hear you and
                      expend one Superiority Die. That creature can immediately use its Reaction to make one attack with
                      a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, adding the Superiority Die to the attack’s damage roll on a hit.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Commanding Presence.</strong><br>
                      When you make a Charisma (Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion) check, you can expend one
                      Superiority Die and add that die to the roll.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disarming Attack.</strong><br>
                      When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die to attempt to
                      disarm the target. Add the Superiority Die roll to the attack’s damage roll. The target must
                      succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop one object of your choice that it’s holding, with the
                      object landing in its space.</p>
                    <p><strong>Distracting Strike.</strong><br>
                      When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die to distract the
                      target. Add the Superiority Die roll to the attack’s damage roll. The next attack roll against the
                      target by an attacker other than you has Advantage if the attack is made before the start of your
                      next turn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Evasive Footwork.</strong><br>
                      As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Superiority Die and take the Disengage action. You also roll
                      the die and add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Feinting Attack.</strong><br>
                      As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Superiority Die to feint, choosing one creature within 5
                      feet of yourself as your target. You have Advantage on your next attack roll against that target
                      this turn. If that attack hits, add the Superiority Die to the attack’s damage roll.</p>
                    <p><strong>Goading Attack.</strong><br>
                      When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die to attempt to goad
                      the target into attacking you. Add the Superiority Die to the attack’s damage roll. The target
                      must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other
                      than you until the end of your next turn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lunging Attack.</strong><br>
                      As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Superiority Die and take the Dash action. If you move at
                      least 5 feet in a straight line immediately before hitting with a melee attack as part of the
                      Attack action on this turn, you can add the Superiority Die to the attack’s damage roll.</p>
                    <p><strong>Maneuvering Attack.</strong><br>
                      When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die to maneuver one of
                      your comrades into another position. Add the Superiority Die roll to the attack’s damage roll, and
                      choose a willing creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its Reaction to move up
                      to half its Speed without provoking an Opportunity Attacks from the target of your attack.</p>
                    <p><strong>Menacing Attack.</strong><br>
                      When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die to attempt to
                      frighten the target. Add the Superiority Die to the attack’s damage roll. The target must succeed
                      on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.</p>
                    <p><strong>Parry.</strong><br>
                      When another creature damages you with a melee attack roll, you can take a Reaction and expend one
                      Superiority Die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your Superiority Die plus your
                      Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p>
                    <p><strong>Precision Attack.</strong><br>
                      When you miss with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die, roll that die, and add it
                      to the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to hit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pushing Attack.</strong><br>
                      When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend
                      one Superiority Die to attempt to drive the target back. Add the Superiority Die to the attack’s
                      damage roll. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be
                      pushed up to 15 feet directly away from you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rally.</strong><br>
                      As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Superiority Die to bolster the resolve of a companion.
                      Choose an ally of yours within 30 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains
                      Temporary Hit Points equal to the Superiority Die roll plus half your Fighter level (round down).
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Riposte.</strong><br>
                      When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can take a Reaction and expend one
                      Superiority Die to make a melee attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike against the
                      creature. If you hit, add the Superiority Die to the attack’s damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sweeping Attack.</strong><br>
                      When you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can
                      expend one Superiority Die to attempt to damage another creature. Choose another creature within 5
                      feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the
                      second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your Superiority Die. The damage
                      is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tactical Assessment.</strong><br>
                      When you make an Intelligence (History or Investigation) check or a Wisdom (Insight) check, you
                      can expend one Superiority Die and add that die to the ability check.</p>
                    <p><strong>Trip Attack.</strong><br>
                      When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend
                      one Superiority Die and add the die to the attack’s damage roll. If the target is Large or
                      smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the Prone condition.</p>
