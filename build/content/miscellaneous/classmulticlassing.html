                  <div id="page-content">

                    <p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. With this rule, you have the option
                      of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level instead of gaining a level in your
                      current class. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept
                      that might not be reflected in a single class.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Prerequisites</span></h3>
                    <p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the
                      new class and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the
                      Druid class must have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher, since Strength is the primary
                      ability for Barbarians and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc1"><span>Experience Points</span></h3>
                    <p>The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on your total character level, not your level
                      in a particular class, as shown in the <a class="newpage"
                        href="/content/classes/class:character-advancement">Character Advancement</a> table in this
                      chapter. For example, if you are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain enough XP to
                      reach level 8 before you can take your second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a
                      Cleric.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc2"><span>Hit Points and Hit Point Dice</span></h3>
                    <p>You gain the Hit Points from your new class as described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1
                      Hit Points for a class only when your total character level is 1.</p>
                    <p>Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these
                      dice are the same die type, you can pool them together. For example, both the Fighter and the
                      Paladin have a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5 Paladin, you have ten d10
                      Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, track them separately. If you are
                      a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin, for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10 Hit Dice.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Proficiency Bonus</span></h3>
                    <p>Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular
                      class, as shown in the Character Advancement table. For example, if you are a level 3 Fighter /
                      level 2 Rogue, you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 character, which is +3.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc4"><span>Proficiencies</span></h3>
                    <p>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of
                      the new class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each class's description in chapter 3.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc5"><span>Class Features</span></h3>
                    <p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features have
                      additional rules when you're multiclassing. Check the information about multiclassing included in
                      each of your classes' descriptions.</p>
                    <p>Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that
                      give you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc6"><span>Armor Class</span></h3>
                    <p>If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor Class, you can benefit from only one at a time.
                      For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Draconic
                      Resilience feature must choose only one of those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc7"><span>Extra Attack</span></h3>
                    <p>If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than one class, the features don't stack. You
                      can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless you have a feature that says you can
                      (such as the Fighter's Two Extra Attacks feature).</p>
                    <p>Similarly, the Warlock's Thirsting Blade invocation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature
                      with your pact weapon, doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc8"><span>Spellcasting</span></h3>
                    <p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting
                      classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting
                      feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting
                      feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spells Prepared.</strong> You determine what spells you can prepare for each class
                      individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger /
                      level 3 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six
                      Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips).</p>
                    <p>Each spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting
                      ability of that class when you cast the spell.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the
                      increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, unless the
                      spell says otherwise.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You determine your available spell slots by adding together the
                      following:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes</li>
                      <li>Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and Ranger classes</li>
                      <li>One third of your Fighter or Rogue levels (round down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or
                        Arcane Trickster subclass.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Then look up this total level in the Level column of the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use
                      the slots for that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from any class whose Spellcasting
                      feature you have.</p>
                    <p>This table might give you spell slots of a higher level than the spells you prepare. You can use
                      those slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like
                      <a href="/content/spells/spellburning-hands">Burning Hands</a>, has an enhanced effect when
                      cast at a higher level, you can use the enhanced effect as normal.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character
                      when determining your spell slots, counting all your levels as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger
                      levels. As shown in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four level 1 spell slots, three
                      level 2 slots, and two level 3 slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells, nor can you
                      prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells
                      you do prepare—and potentially enhance their effects.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pact Magic.</strong> If you have the Pact Magic feature from the Warlock class and the
                      Spellcasting feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic to cast spells you have
                      prepared from classes with the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spellslots you gain from
                      the Spellcasting feature to cast Warlock spells you have prepared.</p>
