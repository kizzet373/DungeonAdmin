                    <p>Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality
                      itself.</p>
                    <p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it
                      this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components.
                      The spell simply takes effect.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't
                        a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an
                        unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</li>
                      <li><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can
                        see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration
                        spell.</li>
                      <li><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one
                        damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</li>
                      <li><strong>Spell Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a
                        single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</li>
                      <li><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your feats with another feat for which
                        you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new
                        one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll
                        made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itselfto accommodate the
                        new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe's
                        Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose
                        whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>
                      <li><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for something not included in any of the other
                        effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude
                        in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that
                        something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only
                        in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish.
                        For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when
                        that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for
                        a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the
                        item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole
                        community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect
                        a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to
                        craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the
                        City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a
                        moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens
                      you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take
                      1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any
                      way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you
                      spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases
                      by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if
                      you suffer this stress.</p>
