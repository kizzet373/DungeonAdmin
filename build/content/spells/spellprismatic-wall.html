                    <p>A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30
                      feet high, and 1 inch thick - centered on a point within range. Alternatively, you shape the wall
                      into a globe up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within range. The wall lasts for the
                      duration. If you position the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the spell ends instantly
                      without effect.</p>
                    <p>The wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and
                      creatures you designate when you cast the spell can pass through and be near the wall without
                      harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 20 feet of it or starts its turn
                      there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for
                      1 minute.</p>
                    <p>The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature reaches into or
                      passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the layers. Each layer forces
                      the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as
                      described in the Prismatic Layers table.</p>
                    <p>The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by
                      means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration. <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellantimagic-field">Antimagic Field</a> has no effect on the wall,
                      and <a href="/content/spells/spelldispel-magic">Dispel Magic</a> can affect only the violet
                      layer.</p>

                            makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves
                            three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the Petrified condition
                            until it is freed by an effect like the <a

                            successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects
                            three of a kind. <em>Additional Effects:</em> Spells can't be cast through this layer, which
                            is destroyed by Bright Light shed by the <a

                            condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another
                            plane of existence (DM's choice). <em>Additional Effects:</em> This layer is destroyed by <a
