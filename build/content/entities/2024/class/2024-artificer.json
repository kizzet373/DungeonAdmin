You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+ -</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature.

Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.</p><p>If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells -</strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability -</strong> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.</p>"
