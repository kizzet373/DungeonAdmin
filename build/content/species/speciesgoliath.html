                    <p>Source: Player's Handbook</p>
                    <p>Towering over most folk, goliaths are distant descendants of giants. Each goliath bears the
                      favors of the first giants - favors that manifest in various supernatural boons, including the
                      ability to quickly grow and temporarily approach the height of goliaths’ gigantic kin.</p>
                    <p>Goliaths have physical characteristics that are reminiscent of the giants in their family lines.
                      For example, some goliaths look like stone giants, while others resemble fire giants. Whatever
                      giants they count as kin, goliaths have forged their own path in the multiverse - unencumbered by
                      the internecine conflicts that have ravaged giantkind for ages - and seek heights above those
                      reached by their ancestors.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Goliath Traits</span></h3>
                    <p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Humanoid<br>
                      <strong>Size:</strong> Medium (about 7-8 feet tall)<br>
                      <strong>Speed:</strong> 35 feet
                    </p>
                    <p>As a Goliath, you have these special traits.</p>
                    <p><strong>Giant Ancestry.</strong> You are descended from Giants. Choose one of the following
                      benefits - a supernatural boon from your ancestry; you can use the chosen benefit a number of
                      times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
                      Rest:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Cloud's Jaunt (Cloud Giant).</strong> As a Bonus Action, you magically teleport up to
                        30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.</li>
                      <li><strong>Fire's Burn (Fire Giant).</strong> When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal
                        damage to it, you can also deal 1d10 Fire damage to that target.</li>
                      <li><strong>Frost's Chill (Frost Giant).</strong> When you hit a target with an attack roll and
                        deal damage to it, you can also deal 1d6 Cold damage to that target and reduce its Speed by 10
                        feet until the start of your next turn.</li>
                      <li><strong>Hill's Tumble (Hill Giant).</strong> When you hit a Large or smaller creature with an
                        attack roll and deal damage to it, you can give that target the Prone condition.</li>
                      <li><strong>Stone's Endurance (Stone Giant).</strong> When you take damage, you can take a
                        Reaction to roll 1d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage
                        by that total.</li>
                      <li><strong>Storm's Thunder (Storm Giant).</strong> When you take damage from a creature within 60
                        feet of you, you can take a Reaction to deal 1d8 Thunder damage to that creature.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Large Form.</strong> Starting at character level 5, you can change your size to Large as
                      a Bonus Action if you're in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until
                      you end it (no action required). For that duration, you have Advantage on Strength checks, and
                      your Speed increases by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish
                      a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Powerful Build.</strong> You have Advantage on any saving throw you make to end the
                      Grappled condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.</p>
