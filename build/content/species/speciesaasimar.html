                    <p>Source: Player's Handbook</p>
                    <p>Aasimar (pronounced AH-sih-mar) are mortals who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their
                      souls. Whether descended from an angelic being or infused with celestial power, they can fan that
                      spark to bring light, healing, and heavenly fury. Aasimar can arise among any population of
                      mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live for up to 160 years and have features that
                      hint at their celestial heritage, such as metallic freckles, luminous eyes, a halo, or the skin
                      color of an angel (silver, opalescent green, or coppery red). These features start subtle and
                      become obvious when the aasimar learns to reveal their full celestial nature.</p>
                    <h1 id="toc0"><span>Aasimar Traits</span></h1>
                    <p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Humanoid<br>
                      <strong>Size:</strong> Medium (about 4-7 feet tall) or Small (about 2-4 feet tall), chosen when
                      you select this species<br>
                      <strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet
                    </p>
                    <p>As an Aasimar, you have these special traits.</p>
                    <p><strong>Celestial Resistance.</strong> You have Resistance to Necrotic damage and Radiant damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <purple><strong>Unify Blessing.</strong> Whenever a creature you can see makes a skill check or a
                        saving throw that you are proficient in, you can use a reaction to give that check advantage.
                        You can do this once until you finish a long rest.</purple>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Healing Hands.</strong> As a Magic action, you touch a creature and roll a number of d4s
                      equal to your Proficiency Bonus. The creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to the total
                      rolled. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Light Bearer.</strong> You know the <a href="/content/spell#light">Light</a>
                      cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Celestial Revelation.</strong> When you reach character level 3, you can transform as a
                      Bonus Action using one of the options below (choose the option each time you transform). The
                      transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it (no action required). Once you transform,
                      you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p>Once on each of your turns before the transformation ends, you can deal extra damage to one
                      target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your
                      Proficiency Bonus, and the extra damage’s type is either Necrotic for Necrotic Shroud or Radiant
                      for Heavenly Wings and Inner Radiance.</p>
                    <p>Here are the transformation options:<br>
                      <strong>Heavenly Wings.</strong> Two spectral wings sprout from your back temporarily. Until the
                      transformation ends, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Inner Radiance.</strong> Searing light temporarily radiates from your eyes and mouth. For
                      the duration, you shed Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet,
                      and at the end of each of your turns, each creature within 10 feet of you takes Radiant damage
                      equal to your Proficiency Bonus.</p>
                    <p><strong>Necrotic Shroud.</strong> Your eyes briefly become pools of darkness, and flightless
                      wings sprout from your back temporarily. Creatures other than your allies within 10 feet of you
                      must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus)
                      or have the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.</p>
