                    <p>Source: Player's Handbook</p>
                    <p>Gnomes are magical folk created by gods of invention, illusions, and life underground. The
                      earliest gnomes were seldom seen by other folk due to the gnomes' secretive nature and their
                      propensity for living in forests and burrows. What they lacked in size, they made up for in
                      cleverness. They confounded predators with traps and labyrinthine tunnels. They also learned magic
                      from gods like Garl Glittergold, Baervan Wildwanderer, and Baravar Cloakshadow, who visited them
                      in disguise. That magic eventually created the lineages of forest gnomes and rock gnomes.</p>
                    <p>Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes and pointed ears, who live around 425 years. Many gnomes
                      like the feeling of a roof over their head, even if that “roof” is nothing more than a hat.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc0"><span>Gnome Traits</span></h3>
                    <p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Humanoid<br>
                      <strong>Size:</strong> Small (about 3-4 feet tall)<br>
                      <strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet
                    </p>
                    <p>As a Gnome, you have these special traits.</p>
                    <p><strong>Gnomish Cunning.</strong> You have Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving
                      throws.</p>
                    <p><strong>Gnomish Lineage.</strong> You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural
                      abilities. Choose one of the following options; whichever one you choose, Intelligence, Wisdom, or
                      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability
                      when you select the lineage):</p>
                    <p>
                      <purple><strong>Gnomish Suppression.</strong> When you fail a saving throw or a creature hits you
                        with an attack, you can use a reaction to have that creature make a wisdom saving throw (DC
                        equal to 8 + proficiency bonus + your modifier for the ability chosen in your Gnomish Lineage
                        feature). On a fail, they take 5 psychic damage, end their turn, and can't take reactions until
                        their next turn. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</purple>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Forest Gnome.</strong> You know the <a
                        href="/content/spells/spellminor-illusion">Minor Illusion</a> cantrip.<br>
                      You also always have the <a href="/content/spells/spellspeak-with-animals">Speak with
                        Animals</a> spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot a number of times equal to your
                      Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You can also use
                      any spell slots you have to cast the spell.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rock Gnome.</strong> You know the <a href="/content/spells/spellmending">Mending</a>
                      and <a href="/content/spells/spellprestidigitation">Prestidigitation</a> cantrips. In
                      addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting Prestidigitation to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC
                      5,1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its
                      function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation; the device produces that effect whenever
                      you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has
                      options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example,
                      if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or
                      extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a
                      time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a
                      Utilize action.</p>
