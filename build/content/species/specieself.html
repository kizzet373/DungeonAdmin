                    <p>Source: Player's Handbook</p>
                    <p>Created by the god Corellon, the first elves could change their forms at will. They lost this
                      ability when Corellon cursed them for plotting with the deity Lolth, who tried and failed to usurp
                      Corellon's dominion. When Lolth was cast into the Abyss, most elves renounced her and earned
                      Corellon’s forgiveness, but that which Corellon had taken from them was lost forever.</p>
                    <p>No longer able to shape-shift at will, the elves retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow was
                      deepened by that plane’s influence. Over time, curiosity led many of them to explore other planes
                      of existence, including worlds in the Material Plane.</p>
                    <p>Elves have pointed ears and lack facial and body hair. They live for around 750 years, and they
                      don't sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to rest. In that state, they remain aware of
                      their surroundings while immersing themselves in memories and meditations.</p>
                    <p>An environment subtly transforms elves after they inhabit it for a millennium or more, and it
                      grants them certain kinds of magic. Drow, high elves, and wood elves are examples of elves who
                      have been transformed thus.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc0"><span>Drow</span></h5>
                    <p>Drow typically dwell in the Underdark and have been shaped by it. Some drow individuals and
                      societies avoid the Underdark altogether yet carry its magic. In the Eberron setting, for example,
                      drow dwell in rainforests and cyclopean ruins on the continent of Xen'drik.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc1"><span>High Elves</span></h5>
                    <p>High elves have been infused with the magic of crossings between the Feywild and the Material
                      Plane. On some worlds, high elves refer to themselves by other names. For example, they call
                      themselves sun or moon elves in the Forgotten Realms setting, Silvanesti and Qualinesti in the
                      Dragonlance setting, and Aereni in the Eberron setting.</p>
                    <h5 id="toc2"><span>Wood Elves</span></h5>
                    <p>Wood elves carry the magic of primeval forests within themselves. They are known by many other
                      names, including wild elves, green elves, and forest elves. Grugach are reclusive wood elves of
                      the Greyhawk setting, while the Kagonesti and the Tairnadal are wood elves of the Dragonlance and
                      Eberron settings, respectively.</p>
                    <h3 id="toc3"><span>Elf Traits</span></h3>
                    <p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Humanoid<br>
                      <strong>Size:</strong> Medium (about 5-6 feet tall)<br>
                      <strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet
                    </p>
                    <p>As an Elf, you have these special traits.</p>
                    <p><strong>Elven Lineage.</strong> You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities.
                      Choose a lineage from the Elven Lineages table. You gain the level 1 benefit of that lineage.</p>
                    <p>When you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn a higher-level spell, as shown on the table.
                      You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the
                      ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any
                      spell slots you have of the appropriate level.</p>
                    <p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this
                      trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage).</p>
                    <p>
                      <purple><strong>Mirage of Mist.</strong> Whenever a creature casts a spell or attack that targets
                        you, you can use a reaction to have the creature make a Wisdom Saving Throw (DC = 8 +
                        Proficiency Bonus + your modifier for you ability chosen in your Elven Lineage feature). On a
                        fail, that creature must change the target of that spell or attack within its range. You can't
                        use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</purple>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the
                      Charmed condition.</p>
                    <p><strong>Keen Senses.</strong> You have proficiency in the Insight, Perception, or Survival skill.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Trance.</strong> You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can
                      finish a Long Rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which
                      you retain consciousness.</p>
