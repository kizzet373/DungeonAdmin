                    <p><i><em>With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside in many societies undetected. Each
                          changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face is
                          only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their
                          soul.</em></i></p>
                    <p><i><em>The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable
                          essence of that plane lingers in changelings today — even in those changelings who have never
                          set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability,
                          channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the
                          sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight
                          the downtrodden.</em></i></p>
                    <p><i><em>In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It
                          is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way
                          others might change clothes. A casual shape — one created on the spur of the moment, with no
                          depth or history — is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a
                          specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop
                          identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs.
                          A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation,
                          investigation, and combat.</em></i></p>
                    <p><i><em>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer
                          changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician.
                          Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take
                          advantage of contacts established by the persona’s previous users.</em></i></p>

                    <p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Fey</p>
                    <p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium or Small</p>
                    <p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Changeling Instincts.</strong> Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain
                        proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation,
                        Performance, or Persuasion.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Shapechanger.</strong> As <purple>a bonus action</purple>, you can change your
                        appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your
                        coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight and can change your
                        size between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though
                        none of your game statistics change. You can’t duplicate the appearance of an individual you’ve
                        never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you
                        have. Your clothing and equipment aren’t changed by this trait.
                        <ul>
                          <li>You stay in the new form until you use <purple>a bonus action</purple> to revert to your
                            true form or until you die.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <purple><strong>Unnerving Visage.</strong>As a reaction when a creature targets you with an
                          attack, you can distort your face into something truly nightmarish or deeply familiar to them.
                          The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier)
                          or suffer disadvantage on the attack roll. On a failure, they are also frightened of you until
                          the end of their next turn. You can't use this again until you finish a long rest.</purple>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
