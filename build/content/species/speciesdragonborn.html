                    <p>The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story
                      holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate
                      the multiverse with people created in their image. Another story claims that dragons created the
                      first dragonborn without the gods’ blessings. Whatever their origin, dragonborn have made homes
                      for themselves on the Material Plane.</p>
                    <p>Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons - scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns
                      on their heads - and their coloration and other features are reminiscent of their draconic
                      ancestors.</p>

                    <p>As a Dragonborn, you have these special traits.</p>
                    <p><strong>Draconic Ancestry.</strong> Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind
                      of dragon from the Draconic Ancestors table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage
                      Resistance traits as well as your appearance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one
                      of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line
                      that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity
                      saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a
                      creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful
                      save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character
                      levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10).</p>
                    <p>You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain
                      all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Damage Resistance.</strong> You have Resistance to the damage type determined by your
                      Draconic Ancestry trait.</p>
                    <purple>
                      <p><strong>Ancient Instincts.</strong> When you take damage, you can use a reaction to fly a
                        number of feet equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus, not provoking opportunity attacks. You
                        can use this once until you finish a long rest.</p>
                    </purple>
                    <p><strong>Draconic Flight.</strong> When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic
                      magic to give yourself temporary flight. As a Bonus Action, you sprout spectral wings on your back
                      that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the
                      Incapacitated condition. During that time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your wings
                      appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use
                      it again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
